## Champions Cohorts

NMFS Openscapes Champions program is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for individuals and research teams in NOAA Fisheries. Read [blog posts](https://openscapes.org/blog#category=noaa-fisheries) about each NMFS Champions Cohort and other NMFS Openscapes activities.

### Example workflow analysis

![](images/nmfs-2022-workflow-analyses.png)

Example workflow analysis by one of the Fall 2022 NMFS Openscapes teams: left) current workflow and right) new workflow. See right figure for color legend. The red lines (left) were critical workflows of data or analyses that the team identified as the key targets for improving their workflow. These red workflows could be automated (coded) but were currently done manually, requiring high staff time and introducing errors due to the number steps involved. In addition, the team identified that all elements of the report were being assembled manually and this was inefficient and introduced unexplained differences between chapters. Workflows analysis is a key component of the Openscapes Champions program. Visualizing workflows and discussing problem areas allows teams to identify the critical problem areas and where to target improvements.

## Upcoming Cohorts

We will lead 3 more [Champions Cohorts in Fall 2025](../champions.qmd).

## Past Cohorts

### 2024

**Fall:** 3 Fall NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohorts were held concurrently during Oct-Dec 2024, with participation of 120 staff and affiliates from a dozen centers, offices, and strategic initiatives ([Cohorts website](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/2024-nmfs-champions/)).

### 2023

**Fall:** We had a NMFS Openscapes Mentors Cohort in Oct-Dec 2023. Besides getting to know many new Open Science early adopters across NMFS, we wrote a paper [Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341) published in Ecology and Evolution. A small group of mentors later participated in the [NASA Spring 2024 Champions cohort](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/champions.html) and got to know the NASA Openscapes mentors. Another group of NMFS Openscapes mentors gave a workshop on cloud-native data access at the EDMW 2024: [Introduction to using earth data in the cloud for scientific workflows](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024/).

### 2022

**Fall:** 4 Fall NMFS Champions Cohorts were held concurrently during Oct-Dec 2022, at AFSC, NWFSC, SWFSC, and SEFSC with participation by PIFSC, NEFSC, OST, and WCRO staff.
