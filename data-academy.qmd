NMFS Openscapes is running a Data Academy Cohort in spring 2025! Read on to learn what this is and how to apply. The Data Academy is being led by Openscapes as part of the Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy. We will run this program 3 times, annually in spring 2025 - 2027.

[Sign up for spring 2025] by close of business **March 24, 2025** <!--- ⬢ Sample email to share announcement **\[LINK\]** --->

## What is the Data Academy?

**What:** You will learn R for data science through lessons on the [dataquest.io](http://dataquest.io) platform. See the [curriculum] below. The Data Academy is **asynchronous** so you can complete the lessons on your own schedule, and also **cohort-based** so you’ll get to know your colleagues and have accountability. The Openscapes team will provide support through **synchronous help desk hours** and a **dedicated Google Space** for help. A training certificate will be issued for each module completed.

**Expected time commitment**: 2-hour chunks of learning time, plus 1 hour of optional "help desk" support, weekly for 3 months.

**When**: April through June, 2025.

-   Mondays: Week’s lesson reminder received via email. Complete lesson on your own schedule.
-   Wednesdays: Help desk with the Openscapes team and other participants (Optional, via Zoom)

**Who**: FTEs and Affiliates from any Fisheries office are welcome to sign up. The 40 available spots will be distributed across centers and offices.

**Cost:** Free. There is no cost to staff or your center/office. This opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes.

## Curriculum

Dataquest offers many different "Learning Paths", including [Career Paths](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/career-paths/) and [Skill Paths](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/career-paths/). These Paths are composed of one or more courses, each of which consist of several modules.

Participants in the Data Academy will complete two Skill Paths:

#### [R Basics for Data Analysis](https://www.dataquest.io/path/r-basics-for-data-analysis/) (4 courses)

-   [Introduction to Data Analysis in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intro-to-r-rewrite/) (weeks 1-3)
-   [Data Structures in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/datastructure-in-r-rewrite/) (weeks 3-7)
-   [Control Flow, Iteration, and Functions in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intermediate-r/) (weeks 7-9)
-   [Specialized Data Processing in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intermediate-r-part-two/) (weeks 9-11)

#### [Data Visualization with R](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-visualization-with-r/) (1 course)

-   [Introduction to Data Visualization in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/r-data-viz/) (weeks 11-13)

During the Data Academy, you will have access to the full dataquest.io library of courses in addition to the R Curriculum. Once you have completed the curriculum for your certificates, we recommend the following additional courses:

-   [Introduction to Data Cleaning in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/r-data-viz-2/)
-   [Introduction to Git and Version Control](https://www.dataquest.io/course/git-and-vcs/)
-   [Querying Databases with SQL and R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/querying-databases-with-r/)

You will receive a certificate for each of the Skills Paths that you complete, as well as for individual courses.

## FAQ

**Who can participate?**

FTEs & Affiliates. We aim to get representation from all NOAA Fisheries science centers, regional offices, and strategic initiatives.

**What’s the minimum I need to know?**

Absolute beginners are encouraged to apply. No prerequisites. People should be comfortable working with data in other contexts (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, GIS, other languages such as Python, Matlab, etc.).

**I know a little bit of R. I’m trying to get better (self-taught), can I participate?**

Yes, you’re welcome, you’ll get a deeper understanding of what you already know and learn new skills beyond.

**How does it relate to Champions/Mentors?**

This is a separate program, but part of the broader Openscapes work with NOAA data and workforce modernization. Participants from past Champions and Mentors are welcome to apply and will learn different skills.
