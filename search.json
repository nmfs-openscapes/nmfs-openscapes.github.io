    "title": "Identifying common approaches and needs for fisheries dependent data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In September-October, Openscapes led a 2-month Champions Cohort with Fisheries Dependent Data (FDD) Users, with over 30 fisheries scientists across academia and NOAA. These scientists were interested in exploring new approaches to working with FDD, which represents a complex mix of data and information collected to facilitate managing the region’s living marine resources. In the US Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of data and information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data can be poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. The FDD Openscapes Cohort was interested in learning ways to explore the potential to leverage FDD in new and innovative ways. It was part of ongoing efforts to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data and associated resources to their full potential.\nThis post focuses on what the cohort setup and participants achieved. It is co-authored with Gavin Fay (UMass Dartmouth) and Andy Jones (NEFSC), who coordinated the cohort, and Anna Holder from California Waterboards, who assisted. This opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and a grant from theFisheries Information System Program through an award toUMass Dartmouth-SMAST throughCINAR. See openscapes.org/champions for more background on the Champions program.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "FDD cohort setup and structure\nWe worked with Gavin Fay in 2020 when his team were Champions in the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Cohort, and the Fay Lab has since shared their experience, created the inspirational (and oft borrowed and remixed) FayLab Manual while practicing and teaching open data science. Gavin and Andy brought together research teams from academia and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the US Northeast to participate in the FDD Cohort. We iterated the Champions program based on what we learned from leading three cohorts in the spring, as we described in a separate post about Fall Cohorts. This was an exciting opportunity to host a cohort that were all focused on similar data and research questions.\nDuring our four cohort calls, the entire cohort discussed what worked and didn’t work for their FDD workflows. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion before closing with suggestions for team meeting topics before next time (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips.\nTwo guest teachers shared about their open data science efforts relevant for FDD audiences. Kim Bastille (NOAA NEFSC) shared about the State of the Ecosystem Product Development Workflow, and described an R package called ecodata that her team created that automates data processing, data sharing, data visualization. Ileana Fenwick (University of North Carolina) taught Data strategies for Future Us, describing data organization in spreadsheets, good enough practices for data management, and tidy data. Both Kim and Ileana are Champions from previous Champions Cohorts (Kim from 2020 NEFSC Cohort and Ileana from the 2021 CS&S Cohort), and it was exciting for them to share not only their expertise through their lessons, but also their experiences learning these tools and workflows with their teams, and what they had done since their Openscapes Cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nThe State of the Ecosystem workflow tree, by Kim Bastille. Kim shared the metaphor of an apple tree when describing their workflow (roots are contributor data, the tree trunk is their ecodata R package, and the branches, leaves, and apples are the final products. Although final products (apples) may be varied, the workflows stay the same."

    "section": "What did the participants achieve?",
    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis was an exciting cohort because participants were focused on a common topic: research using FDD data. We had both data users (largely academic) and data providers (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center) in the Cohort, and they were able to share common issues and approaches that could benefit others in the group. Many topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 FDD Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples.\nSharing data isn’t the only way to practice open science. Many aspects of FDD can be confidential, meaning that it cannot be shared publicly or has special considerations for sharing. We discussed how there are ways to be open and collaborative even if you can’t share the data itself. For example, sharing documentation and metadata is a way to be open and collaborative, even if you cannot share the data. Making knitted (RMarkdown) documents that show data summaries even when raw data can’t be accessed is another strategy. Another approach is to provide a “toy” or simulated dataset with all the right fields so that code can be developed, then shared with a partner who has access to the confidential data and can run the code on their own. Further, location data can be jittered, vessel IDs can be anonymized, and data can be collapsed or summarized in a way to protect the confidential aspects of the dataset before sharing it broadly. We also discussed different definitions and examples of confidential data, and how folks treat it differently within an agency, and outwardly for users. Do we all agree on what confidential data actually is? Does everyone know how to handle confidential data properly?\nPsychological safety. When we discussed the importance of psychological safety, participants had great ideas for how to help foster more trust and safety in teams. For example, instead of “do you have any questions?” asking “what questions do you have?”, and creating spaces where individuals can be vulnerable to role model and encourage group vulnerability and trust. The cohort emphasized and reiterated that building trust and vulnerability takes time; it is built/earned through little moments and actions, not given outright - and it’s important for those that hold power (PIs, supervisors, managers, etc.) to lead by example and make space for those little moments within their teams. Others noted how important psychological safety was in this area where often data sets are not well documented and communication is essential to the proper use of the data.\nTooling helped teams collaborate - but Github and Slack are not the only options! Utilizing tools like Slack and GitHub can help some teams streamline and advance their communication and collaboration workflows, but that doesn’t mean those specific tools will work for everyone. Some individuals and teams in the FDD Cohort were already avid R/GitHub users, others were interested in using those tools more (GitHub Projects, and Issues, anyone?), and some individuals were not as keen on embedding a whole new software like GitHub or Slack into their workflows. Regardless of any individual’s interest or current abilities with a certain tool, everyone was able to use the Openscapes mindset to think about tools and workflows they currently use, explore how they are serving their teams (or not), and brainstorm ways to improve their data and communication workflows independent of any specific tool. Some teams in the FDD cohort regularly work with partners that may not have access to such tools, or even have access to the Internet. Teams began to discuss what to do in those situations and used their Seaside Chats to brainstorm and find solutions that work for them.\nCode of Conduct for Data? In our final session one group shared that with their Pathway they had thought a lot about codes of conduct, and how they could be used to be more clear about how to work with data, data access, and acknowledging contributors across multiple institutions. Other groups agreed, thinking that this could be another form of metadata that would be very helpful to refer to before, during, and after the project. It could also help streamline onboarding of team members as they enter projects, and offboarding team members before they move on. The question of “Who owns the data?”, from principles of anti-colonial science, was an important framing, and folks recommended viewing the recording of Dr. Max Liboiron’s recent keynote about research, communication, and land relations.\nCodes of conduct and other types of transparent documentation are important for external partners or the public - just as they are for future us as individuals, as teams, and as organizations. Developing codes of conduct resonated with the FDD cohort because they could be used as a way to be explicit about team or organization’s values (like psychological safety) and standardize a way to document the metadata associated with how we work (where to find data, how to organize and use it, what can be shared, what should remain confidential, etc.)\nWe loved working and learning with this cohort of fisheries scientists and exploring the challenges they face. The following is a bit more about each team; look out for further blogs about what the Openscapes team learned and what’s coming next."

    "text": "FDD Cohort teams\nThe Cadrin team at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is a collaboration among academic, federal and state scientists as well as people in the groundfish fishing industry to develop standardized indices of groundfish stock abundance by managing and analyzing fishery monitoring data. There are several data streams and alternative modeling approaches that would benefit from the Openscapes program for efficiency, transparency and reproducibility to produce the best scientific information available to assess and manage fisheries.\nThe Humphries team at the University of Rhode Island uses a combination of field experiments, underwater surveys, and interviews to study fish and fisheries. Their goal is to link ecological interactions with social dynamics in order to evaluate and prioritize management solutions.\nThe Hyde team has multiple members from NEFSC, GARFO, academia and industry. Currently all work is being done by individuals, but they are hoping Openscapes will help them improve collaboration and make their work more transparent for the public.\nThe Mills team is leading novel research projects that strive to develop models to meet the complex challenges facing marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities. They are continually working to improve our quantitative capabilities by including more spatial and temporal data at finer resolutions, combining quantitative and qualitative information to make the best use of available data, and developing more sophisticated modeling frameworks that can accommodate complex data, such as fisheries dependent data. We hope that the skills we learn will advance our abilities such that our questions, and in turn the impact of our findings, are not constrained by technological limitations.\nThe Selden team is composed of members from diverse backgrounds, including graduate students, professors, and individuals who work at non-profits. They have research backgrounds in geography, ecology, and oceanography and have mastered how to talk across these disciplines, and are now analyzing how fishing communities have responded to past, and present distribution shifts of target species and creating an index of vulnerability to future climate change.\nThe Stoll team is interested in the human dimensions of fisheries and ocean systems and how policies and practices shape people’s interactions with the marine environment. This focus means that they tend to engage with FDD in unconventional ways that both present challenges and also create opportunities to further our knowledge about fisheries and the people who depend on them for food and livelihood. The goal of participating in the Champions cohort is to both improve our research skills and (long-term) to help institutionalize open data science.\nThe Fay team focuses on developing interdisciplinary modelling approaches to extend the scope of applications for fisheries and ecosystem assessment methods, and testing the performance of decision support tools for living marine resource management. They apply a range of statistical and modelling approaches for the assessment and management of fish, marine mammal, and marine reptile populations, and actively collaborate with academic and agency scientists in the Northeast US, US West Coast, Australia, and Europe.\nThe Jones/NEFSC team in part collects FDD in collaboration with the fishing industry, which can be underutilized, in part due to the complex nature and challenges creating reproducible research products. They are interested in strengthening open science approaches to increase the value of these data by opening the door to new users who have previously been unable to use the data sets due to their complex nature.\n \n\nThe SOE apple tree presented by Kim Bastille."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On April 22, 2025 Openscapes hosted a Community Call to share what we’re learning about cloud costs for Earth science workflows in our JupyterHubs. We are working deeply with NASA Openscapes Mentors and NOAA Openscapes Mentors to use, teach, and develop with 2i2c; and increasingly have cross-NASA collaborations with other hubs like the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and CryoCloud. This was a first conversation. There is so much more to share than we had time for, and there was a lot more interest in questions and community examples. Through a light interview structure, Andy Teucher (Openscapes), Alex Lewandowski (NASA Alaska Satellite Facility), Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries), Tasha Snow (CryoCloud), and Yuvi (2i2c) shared their experiences and what they are building.\nQuick links:\nOpenscapes and our partners at NASA, NOAA, and 2i2c have been learning together about monitoring and managing the costs of cloud computing in a JupyterHub. Many organizations are starting to use cloud computing for computational analysis and teaching workshops, often using JupyterHubs as the platform for this work.  Tracking usage and attributing costs to specific users and workflows can be tricky on these shared hubs, and we have been learning some strategies and tools to help us understand them. The purpose of this Community Call was to share what we’ve learned so far: tools and processes to explore cloud costs, as well as figures like the basic costs for hosting a hub, cost per user, cost per science workflow, and what it costs to run a workshop in the hub.\nOne punchline: yes it is possible to run real science workflows in different Hubs – and we can estimate the costs. An example workflow transported from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) OpenSARLab to NASA Openscapes Hub cost $0.74. This cost does not reflect the cost of technical infrastructure & development, plus the training and upskilling the researcher needs. When comparing costs, it is important to keep in mind that different JupyterHubs have different focuses (e.g., data type(s) and usage patterns) and, consequently, different architectures that can greatly affect costs even for similar workflows. Yet, it is an exciting step in understanding the cost of earth science workflows in the cloud!\nThe format of the call was several stories and demos from this cutting-edge collaboration between open source infrastructure, government agencies, science communities (slides). Here is the story arc, and a few key notes."

This post is the executive summary shared with Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) leadership of the work and experiences of AFSC research staff participants.\nUpdate February 21, 2023\nAFSC supported 8 teams from across the center in the 2022 Fall Openscapes Cohort of the Openscapes Champions training program. The teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries surveys, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, fish life history, and survey preparation. The teams consisted of 39 AFSC researchers from 7 AFSC divisions. Three of the 8 teams were cross-divisional. All teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; improving on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. This was achieved in the context of expanding open data science efforts within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nFor each team, the training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the four-week course of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and time to tackle previously intangible tasks, track their progress, and install long-term collaboration and project management practices. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals with unique approaches, they often came to realize that their work needs had universal themes. Teams found new ways to fulfill needs for increased transparency, inclusivity, streamlining workflows, and professional development. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence. Participants in the training also recognized the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Jupyter notebooks, Julia, Git and GitHub, Quarto, Posit Connect, reproducible analysis, and collaborative writing). The AFSC can support these needs by 1) identifying and funding training opportunities, and 2) encouraging scientists and supervisors to allocate work time to expanding knowledge and exploring new open data science skills.\nAs in the first AFSC Openscapes cohort, participants from this cohort found the training transformative. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors, we are committed to maintaining the community of support and active learning that was established during the training. We feel confident that AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open data science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication with stakeholders."

    "text": "The Teams and Their Achievements\nThe 2022 Fall Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from October 5 to November 30, 2022. Cohort calls focused on 1) establishing open science mindset and introducing psychological safety (call 1 digest), 2) publishing and project management on GitHub (call 2 digest), 3) instituting team culture and data strategies (call 3 digest), 4) nurturing open science communities and coding strategies (call 4 digest), and 5) developing each team’s path forward as they continue their open science journeys after Openscapes training (call 5 digest). Participants’ GitHub usernames are provided within each team description to connect them to their Openscapes work.\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of some of AFSC’s Openscapes participants over Zoom\n\n\n\nThe Marine Mammal Lab/RSST Lab Manual team focused their efforts on developing lab manuals for their teams. This team includes Katie Luxa (@katie-luxa), Erin Moreland (@eem1), Kim Shelden (@kewshel), Nancy Friday (@NAFriday), Cynthia Christman (@ChristmanCL), and Joanna Magner (@joannamagner-noaa; RSST). This cross-division collaboration gave the participants a wider-ranging perspective and an understanding of the universal problems different teams experience. Their lab manual covers on-/off-boarding, outreach, lab safety, field safety, travel, time and attendance, and employee resources. This lab manual was developed by referencing other lab manuals (e.g., Fay lab manual and with the team’s new skills in Quarto, GitHub repo and project management, and GitHub issue tracking. The lab manuals team saw this effort as an opportunity to unbury important lab and employee info from emails in one accessible page. Once complete, this MML lab manual will be moved to the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab GitHub Organization. The members of this team felt that their achievements and end products were more robust and inclusive because of how diversified their team was. The members of this team work across different programs and specialize in research on different species, and could share nuanced perspectives of what different documents and resources should include.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab Manual.\n\n\n\nThe AFSC Genetics team is motivated to develop a streamlined analysis pipeline. This team is represented by Patrick Barry (@PatrickBarry-NOAA), Diana Baetscher (@DianaBaetscher-NOAA), Sara Schaal (@SaraSchaal), and Claire Tobin (@ClaireTobin-NOAA). The team created a new GitHub organization that allows them to oversee product development, assign issues, and direct overall project management in teams that include postdocs and collaborators. GitHub provides tools for code versioning, documentation, and product testing that were critical for developing this pipeline. Together, they created different GitHub repositories for different projects and initiatives (e.g., sample collection, lab work, data storage) with links to resources and google docs. Members of the team came from a wide range of open science experience levels and worked together to teach and learn from each other through this process.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Genetics GitHub Organization.\n\n\n\nThe PCod Tagging and MARVLS team set out on the dynamic task of streamlining multiple data sources to product workflow and diversified data management. This team is comprised of Susanne McDermott (@smcdermo), Julie Nielsen (@jknielsen), Kimberly Rand (@kimberlyrand), Liz Dawson (@liz-dawson-NOAA), Bianca Prohaska (@bianca-prohaska-NOAA), Christina Conrath (@ConrathCl), and Ajith Abraham (@Abraham-7600; OFIS) and ranged across several Pacific cod tagging sub-projects across RACE, the Maturity Assessment, Reproductive Variability, Life Strategy (MARVLS) group, and OFIS. Data from the tagged fish are opportunistically collected when a tag pops off a fish and reaches the sea surface and satellite connection and need to be regularly integrated into reports, websites, and on data sharing platforms. The team used mural boards to assist planning their database workflow and design. This visualization also helped motivate the team, outline what the next steps were, and create and assign tasks. When the team participants came together to work on this project, they were confronted with how similar their project themes and needs were.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the PCod Tagging Team’s database proposed design and workflow in Mural.\n\n\n\nThe MML Field Report team focused on new methods for working together and developing a ready-for-publication field report. This team includes Kim Goetz (@kimtgoetz), Megan Ferguson (@megancatonferguson), Molly McCormley (@mmccorml), Burlyn Birkmeier (@burlynb), and Amelia Brower (@ameliabrower-noaa). For this project, the team leaned on Eli Holmes’s book chapter code and quarto discussion forums, especially since Quarto is new and quickly evolving. This allowed the team to delegate chapter assignments and other report tasks (e.g., create a new section, edit yaml file, build report) through GitHub issues for team members to work on. The iterative and collaborative nature of the GitHub platform allowed the team to work through the idiosyncrasies of book and page formatting.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the MML field report team’s draft field report pdf made in Quarto.\n\n\n\nThe Oyster Monitoring and MML team comprises Peter Mahoney (@pmahoney-noaa), Skyla Walcott (@skylawalcott), Alex Zerbini (@alex-zerbini), Gavin Brady (@GavinMBrady), and Jordan Hollarsmith (@jhollarsmithnoaa). The team is formed of a composite of people from across the center who assisted their peers on their Oyster Monitoring project GitHub repository. For this effort, the team discussed how their universal work needs can be improved by universal lessons and learning GitHub project boards, Quarto, Mural boards (inspired by the PCod tagging team) and RMarkdown. The team worked together to develop the repository and documentation, and they worked with a SeaGrant Fellow to make an interactive quarto report website for the project!\nThe Groundfish Assessment Program Data Workflow team is working to codify the methods used to calculate survey design-based indices. This is a partnership of the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska/Aleutian Islands groups, including Duane Stevenson (@Duane-Stevenson-NOAA), Lukas DeFilippo (@Lukas-DeFilippo-NOAA), and Sarah Friedman (@SarahFriedman-NOAA), and Zack Oyafuso (@zoyafuso-NOAA). There are many bespoke scripts across the survey groups, for calculations of slightly different flavors of design-based indices, of which running each was often siloed to one person and underwent little to no code review. Expanding on the work already in the GAP Data Products GitHub organization, the team is developing an R package that will consolidate these analyses, interact directly with GAP Oracle databases, and include instructional documentation and vignettes. The package will undergo annual code review and validation, and promote greater collaboration and transparency with data users (e.g., stock assessors). The team relied on GitHub for version control, to post, task, and address issues. In addition, the team led an effort to include the other members of GAP, by initiating working groups to focus on data processes, computations, and future technologies. The team hopes this effort will bring the two survey groups closer together, make these analyses repeatable and transferable, and help develop a future vision for Future Us.\nThe MACE team was represented by Denise McKelvey (@mckelveyd), Katherine Wilson (@KatherineWilson-NOAA), and David McGowan (@McGowanDW). The program provided the space and guidance for this team to further increase their skills in, and awareness of, the platforms that MACE already uses for collaborative development, maintenance, and sharing of code and standardized reports. The tutorials offered by Eli Holmes (@eeholmes) and the examples of how others have adapted these lessons inspired the team members to envision new ways to collaborate as a team and leverage these tools. The course reinforced the team’s knowledge that Git can facilitate collaborations and increase efficiency by streamlining workflows, tracking issues, and supporting reproducibility. The team appreciated the coding tips that were shared and the cultural change movement that the course inspires: shifting away from work silos and moving towards collaborative and open approaches.\nThe REFM Spectroscopy Tools for Life History Measurements team comprised Esther Goldstein (@EstherDGoldstein-NOAA), Sandi Neidetcher (@SandiKay), Morgan Arrington (@MorganArrington-NOAA), Irina Benson (@ibens-git), and Beth Matta (@BethMatta-NOAA). This team is working to develop standardized scripts for processing and analyzing spectroscopy data that can be reviewed and shared easily among multiple individuals and centers. This effort is part of a NOAA-wide strategic initiative to develop spectroscopy as a tool for life history measurements (e.g., age, maturity, fish condition). The team realized the need to shift away from siloed scripts used by individuals for specific projects to a generalized open-source format. The team discussed how their work can be improved by using GitHub repositories to review and share scripts, GitHub projects to track issues to assign tasks, and RMarkdown/ Quarto for generating reports more efficiently. The team worked together to develop a GitHub organization, their first repository, practice reviewing scripts, and address issues as a team."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This Fall we have been leading three Champions Cohorts, with Fisheries Dependent Data Users (FDD), NOAA’s National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS), and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Symbiosis in Aquatic Systems Initiative (SASI). We’ll share separate blog posts about each Cohort; here we wanted to focus on how we have been iterating the Champions program.\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Program is a leadership and professional development program modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, focused on research teams, with original curriculum modeled from open data science lessons learned from the Ocean Health Index. We led 1 Champions Cohort in both 2019 and 2020; in 2021 we’ve led 6 Cohorts, learning and iterating each time. This Spring we introduced the 2-month series with NWFSC, CS&S, and CSU COAST Cohorts, and followed up with 3-month check-ins where Champions shared and screenshared about their efforts for shared project management and onboarding new group members.\nOver the Summer we invested what we had learned from Spring cohorts back into the Champions program to prepare for the 3 Fall cohorts. The updates to Fall Champions Cohorts include:\nCohort GitHub repos - we created a GitHub repository and website for each cohort in advance (FDD, NMFS, and SASI), to serve several purposes. It was a place to post information about the cohort: times we meet and teams involved, and to showcase how to make a website from a GitHub repository. It also provided a place for Champions to work during the GitHub Clinics (which previously had been in temporary repos), and give a continued space to practice Markdown, Issues, and Projects after the clinics. We also posted summary digest following each call using Issues instead of email.\nGitHub Clinics - Teaching our GitHub Clinic as one of four cohort calls in the 2-month Cohorts felt tight in the Spring, so this fall we experimented having these Clinics as a fifth, optional, stand-alone call. We recorded it for folks that couldn’t make the additional times, and it seemed to still be impactful for participants – GitHub for project management was a big theme for the NMFS and FDD cohorts.\nGuest teachers - We invited guest teachers to share their expertise with the Cohorts, either by presenting existing curriculum or sharing something from their work within the existing themes in the Champions curriculum. This was a way to include community members, hear different stories and examples, and tailor the curriculum for different cohorts depending on the expertise of the guest teacher.\nSlack - We invited Fall Champions teams to Openscapes Slack after our first cohort call, providing each cohort with a private channel. This aligns with our approach that open science is a spectrum, and working openly with yourself, your team, and your cohort helps you build habits and confidence so you can work more openly with others when you’re ready. Fall Champions are able to interact within their private cohort channel as well as community channels to check-in between calls and share questions and resources.\nCo-working - Something we do within our team that we’ve introduced this Fall are co-working sessions where we work at the same time together via Zoom. This is different from office hours but a chance for Champions to come together and work on something with low-key accountability and community, and to talk things out and ask questions. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves screensharing to problem solve.\nOnboarding Mentors - We’ve had a lot of help leading the Fall Cohorts, and are so grateful to partner mentors co-leading and assisting. We began working with and onboarding these mentors over the summer while also beginning writing the Openscapes Approach Guide to help document our process. We will have further blog posts about what we all learned and did together and are so grateful to Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and Corey Clatterbuck (California Water Boards) with the NMFS cohort, Anna Holder (California Water Boards) and Rachel Baum (UMassD Claire T. Carney Library) with the FDD cohort, and Lenny Teytelman (protocols.io) and Emma Ganley (protocols.io) with the SASI cohort!\nIt’s always great to see what topics resonate with different teams, and how they focus efforts in the interplay of software and culture; for example by using GitHub Projects as a way to strengthen collaborations between colleagues who are and aren’t yet coders, and provide a way to onboard folks if they’d like to learn more. Stay tuned for blogs sharing more details about the Fall Cohorts, and we’ll be iterating further in 2022, building from what works and experimenting further!\n  \n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

They are scannable visual aids that use layout and visual mnemonics to help people zoom to the functions they need.’ (Posit cheatsheets README). Many of us wanted to know how she figured out what to include and how to do it effectively. Sophie added notes in a GitHub Issue, which evolved into blog post to include perspectives of her colleagues who had recently developed cheatsheets. This is a gold mine!

    "text": "Sophie Breitbart: Cheatsheet for the asar R package\nAt a late August NOAA Fisheries Openscapes coworking, I shared that I’d finished the first version of the {asar} cheatsheet. After some further feedback, the cheatsheet was updated once more. We plan to continually update the cheatsheet as our package evolves. Here’s some insight into how I made this cheatsheet (my first!):\n\nApproach\n\nI looked at several cheatsheets for design inspiration first. Here are links to cheatsheets from Posit and contributors.\nI read some guidance for designing a cheatsheet. I certainly didn’t follow all of it, but it had some great reminders about balancing text with visual depictions, emphasis on conciseness and differentiation from documentation, and the value of sample code.\nI also started a back-and-forth with Gemini to see what it could produce. I supplied it a link to {asar}’s functions and asked it to make a cheatsheet that looked similar to Posit’s cheatsheets. I tried several prompts to get it to produce something I liked, but I ultimately gave up. It was still useful though, in that this exercise showed me what I did and didn’t want in a cheatsheet:\n\nGemini grouped content by function type but I realized I wanted {asar}’s to be structured by workflow (i.e., chronologically, so to speak).\nGemini could format in HTML or markdown, but there were features I appreciated about the classic Powerpoint-based cheatsheets it couldn’t replicate (or, at least, I didn’t have the patience to keep trying to write the perfect prompt to achieve my vision). It’s tricky to articulate exactly what those things are, but here are some:\n\nUsage of white space\nFreedom to create and position visual aids\nProperly-fitting columns\nNeat fit onto one page that could be printed out for future reference digitally or on paper as workshop handouts\n\nI also wanted to add other information like data science tips and links to {asar} resources like vignettes and issues.\n\nSo I opened the powerpoint template and began customizing its three-column template.\nAbout 1/3 of the way through, I asked my colleague Sam Schiano for her initial thoughts and if this was going in the right direction. She gave some great feedback that invited further edits.\nMy colleague Kelli Johnson also shared some thoughts on how to make the first version clearer and more useful. One of my biggest takeaways was that the cheatsheet would be stronger if more space was devoted to depicting how functions work and what the expected output should look like. Ideally, the cheatsheet would allow the user to start understanding the workflow and intuiting how to navigate it. A deepener familiarity with the tool will encourage adoption and more productive troubleshooting.\nI’m sure we’ll edit it as we learn more from our users about what’s most important for them. Maybe we’ll make a more reproducible version based in a format like Quarto, too.\n\n\n\nTools\n\nI used open source icons from Ionicons and Feather to symbolize the purpose of each section.\nI used this Posit cheatsheet pptx template, then downloaded it as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheatsheet for the asar R package for Automated Stock Assessment Reporting"

    "text": "Samantha Schiano: Cheatsheet for the stockplotr R package\nI am a member of the team that develops {asar} (the package mentioned by Sophie Breitbart earlier in this blog post!). We also develop a sister package called stockplotr which focuses on creating tables and plots for fisheries stock assessments. There are an increasing number of awesome functions we have developed to allow users to create their plots and tables in one click or customize themselves. While Sophie took on the task of developing the cheatsheet for {asar}, I took on creating the cheatsheet for {stockplotr}. I aimed to make a similar looking cheatsheet to {asar} in order to create a cohesive feel across our packages. It was also my first time making a cheatsheet and I learned a lot from Sophie and through my own process.\n\nApproach\nLike Sophie, I looked at several cheatsheets for inspiration focusing on cheatsheets that were made for packages similar to{stockplotr}, like {dplyr} and {ggplot2}. Since a lot of the functions in {stockplotr} are “wrappers” of {ggplot2}, it made sense to begin by modeling the {stockplotr} cheatsheet off of the {ggplot2} one. I followed some guidance from the RStudio cheatsheet:\n\norganize content into 3-4 columns,\nensure content follows the order that your eye usually reads in (top–&gt;bottom, left–&gt;right),\nuse visual elements to make the sheet scannable,\nadd ready-to-run code where possible,\nincorporate example tables and,\ncreate a visual hierarchy.\n\nI used these concepts and more to try and build a visually pleasing and intuitive cheatsheet that would be highly informative to the package user.\n{stockplotr} isn’t just producing plots and tables, but also creates captions and alternative text for the plots and tables. This means that the package has a lot of functionality that needs to be conveyed to users, so (for now) I focused on including only stable functions in the cheatsheet in addition to information on how captions and alternative text are generated. The explanation of how captions and alternative text are generated was important to seamlessly integrate {stockplotr} products with the products generated in {asar}, so users really need to understand this process to take full advantage of the feature.\n\nI played around with the visual structure and font size. I think one of my biggest takeaways from this is that you shouldn’t feel confined to a specific look or flow and that you CAN make your font smaller. After looking at some other cheatsheets, I realized that the ones that have a lot of functions use a smaller font to get everything to fit and still flow cohesively.\n\nLastly, don’t feel pressured to just have a 1-pager! As we develop and expand {stockplotr}, I plan on keeping this original cheatsheet as an overview of the package with two additional pages for the package: one for plots and one for tables. Other packages follow this convention and it can be extremely helpful when executed well by being easier to navigate and communicating the expanse and complexity of the package.\n\n\nTools\n\nI used the same open source icons and cheatsheet template as Sophie.\nI gained inspiration from the {ggplot2} cheatsheet and the {dplyr} cheatsheet."

    "text": "Kelli Johnson: Cheatsheet for the FIMS package\nLike others, my inspiration for creating a cheatsheet came from my consistent use of Posit cheatsheets. In fact, I have my book of cheatsheets from the 2024 Posit conference within arms reach of my desk at all times. I find that these cheatsheets offer information that just cannot be found through the traditional R documentation, i.e.,?function_name, and I often go to them for their visuals rather than their text.\n\nApproach\nPosit makes it extremely easy to mimic the structure of their cheatsheets with their publicly-available powerpoint template on their GitHub repository, which stores pdf versions of their cheatsheets. I followed the instructions in their README for how to edit their template to create a cheatsheet for {FIMS}. Given that we had already created a vignette for beginners, it was easy to decide the flow of the cheatsheet, which mimics the flow of the vignette.\nWhere I deviated from the Posit instructions is in getting feedback. The instructions emphasize that the design process will be iterative but they do not stress the importance of getting feedback from individuals outside of the development team. Developers have too much background information to be able to “see” the vignette for the first time, similar to how native speakers of a language can deal with typoglycemia. To ensure that new users would find the vignette helpful, we had to test it out on new users. Therefore, we held a work session to get feedback from two individuals who had never used the package before and two individuals who were on the development team. The combination of their perspectives really helped bring the cheatsheet to the next level.\nWhen receiving feedback, it is often difficult to wade through all of the comments without getting lost. I try to group comments together into similar themes and focus on the theme with the most feedback first. Additionally, sometimes I do not understand what someone else’s vision would look like so I ask them to directly edit the cheatsheet the way they think it should look. Given that google slides allows you to revert back using the history, I am not concerned with maintaining a copy of the original cheatsheet while they are editing. I feel that by allowing the provider of the feedback to have direct edit access they may feel more empowered, recognized, and willing to contribute. Their ideas were often quite good and we typically ended up keeping their edits.\nWhile designing the cheatsheet I felt like I spent too much time on icons that I ended up not using. I feel like I should have focused more time on the visuals that represent functions, e.g., table snapshots and function output.\nThe beauty of this process is that it is not over. We tagged the slide with the version and each time we have a new release of {FIMS} we can update the slide deck given comments we have received. It will be important to keep asking for feedback though because many have comments but do not actively voice them or even know where to provide them.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nPrint it to a pdf and provide the image in the {pkgdown} documentation available on the documentation for {FIMS}.\nUpdate the cheatsheet for our newest release of version 0.7.0.\nAdd an additional page that summarizes how to run sensitivity models and look at the model output.\nGet more feedback to ensure the cheatsheet is the best that it can be."

    "title": "Receiving the Dr. Greg Leptoukh Award lecture at AGU",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the AGU 2025 Fall Meeting I received the AGU Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award. This award celebrates the life of an inspiring Earth scientist in our community and recognizes significant contributions to informatics, computational, or data sciences through research, education, and related activities. Receiving this award is a huge honor. I have worked hard and am proud of what I have done for science, scientists, and people supporting science. And I greatly value my many collaborators who work closely with me; we are receiving this award together. I know this award reflects all our work, as well as me, and it’s really special to be called out.\nThe blog shares a quick overview of my lecture. It focuses on the official citation for my award written by NASA Openscapes Mentors Aaron Friesz (now at ESIP), Amy Steiker, Luis Lopez, plus Allison Horst, and my official response. I will give the lecture again online in early 2026 – we will share details when we know – and we will update this post with a recording.\nQuicklinks:\n\nSlides - ”Forking as a Worldview”: How Openscapes uses the open source concept of copy-modify to support researchers & shift culture in science\nhttps://www.agu.org/honors/leptoukh\nhttps://www.agu.org/honors/leptoukh/past-recipients\n\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news.\n\nIn December 2025 in New Orleans, as part of the Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award I gave a 75-minute invited lecture: ”Forking as a Worldview: How Openscapes uses the open source concept of copy-modify to support researchers & shift culture in science”. Openscapes Mentors were sitting in the front row, boosting my courage and sharing my joy.\nI co-authored the talk with the Openscapes Core Team: Stefanie Butland, Andy Teucher, Melanie Burgess, Stephanie Amend, Ileana Fenwick, Liz Neeley. We told more stories and practices of our team – the unseen infrastructure that enables us to have outsized impact, and continually expand possibilities with our collaborators.\n\n\n\n\nAaron Friesz, Amy Steiker, Sudhir Shrestha, Julie Lowndes, Danie Kinkade, Alex Lewandowski, Luis Lopez as Julie receives Leptoukh Award, AGU 2025.\n\n\n\nThe talk’s structure (forked from my documenting things talk at Posit Conf 2023):\n\nForking mindset - forking (v) means to copy and modify. We fork code, and also ideas, structures, agendas, documentation, programs…\nWhat’s possible from this + how we work - stories of how forking has made it possible for NOAA scientists to develop collaborative workflows for data-intensive science; how forking has made it possible for NASA data center staff to revolutionize Earthdata workflows in the Cloud; and how forking has made it possible for Openscapes to be sustainable. This was my first time talking more about how I shifted from academic scientist to small business owner and growing the team to support the work we do.\nMeeting the moment together - it’s been a hard, disappointing year. And yet. We can all continue to work together, create our own certainty, default to open. The (Hidden) social infrastructure that drives this is scaled with trust and kindness.\n\n\nOfficial AGU Citation - Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award\nNote: this citation and response will be posted on Julie’s AGU profile in the coming months.\nDr. Julia Stewart Lowndes is transforming environmental and Earth science through her visionary leadership in open, collaborative, and inclusive data science. She has redefined how scientific teams work together—empowering researchers to do better science in less time, together—and inspiring a movement toward more effective, inclusive, and reproducible Research.\nTrained as a marine scientist with a Ph.D. from Stanford University, and later as a scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), Dr. Lowndes gained key insights into the challenges faced by solo scientists when working with big data. Her 2017 paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, “Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools,” (Lowndes et al. 2017) articulated a compelling vision for modernizing scientific workflows. By addressing both the technical and human challenges of data science, her work has catalyzed cultural change across government agencies, academic institutions, and research networks.\nIn 2018, Dr. Lowndes founded Openscapes, a pioneering program that mentors individuals and research teams in open, reproducible, and collaborative science. Through initiatives such as NASA Openscapes, she has reshaped how NASA data centers and researchers collaborate—accelerating cloud migration, strengthening interdisciplinary connections, and fostering psychological safety within teams. Openscapes’ work with NOAA, NASA, and EPA has advanced the culture of open science across the federal research landscape and was featured in the White House’s 2024 Year of Open Science fact sheet for its exemplary mentorship with NOAA Fisheries.\nDr. Lowndes is also a dedicated advocate for equity and inclusion in data science. She co- founded R-Ladies Santa Barbara and advises the Pathways to Open Science program supporting Black environmental and marine researchers. Her efforts have built welcoming communities that empower those historically excluded from technical fields to lead in open Science.\nDr. Lowndes exemplifies the spirit of the Greg Leptoukh Lecture, which honors innovations in informatics that enable scientific discovery. Like Greg Leptoukh, she recognizes that progress in science depends not only on technical excellence but also on collaboration, transparency, and community. Her leadership has created a more inclusive, efficient, and hopeful model for how science is done—making her a profoundly deserving recipient of this honor.\nAaron Friesz, Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)\nNASA Openscapes Mentors and Allison Horst\n\n\nJulia’s Response - Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award\nIt is an absolute honor to receive the Greg Leptoukh Lecture award recognizing innovations in computational and data informatics that enable scientific discovery. I feel an intense upwelling of love and gratitude for my colleagues that is difficult to describe. It is a privilege to feel such joy about one’s colleagues. And yet, it is quite a common trait of our greater open science community that reflects the deep value of collaboration through trust, empathy, and kindness.\nI created Openscapes to be a feeling of welcome and empowerment around data-intensive science, having felt this myself as a marine ecologist welcomed and empowered by the R open source programming community. Since 2018 we’ve been directly mentoring nearly one thousand researchers and people supporting research, while co-creating mechanisms together so we can all turn around and support countless others within our work-lives. We continue to learn from, with, and for each other, every effort turning our Flywheel (Robinson and Lowndes 2022). We reuse and “fork” what works in new places, using a concept from software engineering for reuse and credit. Openscapes now means more to people than I can possibly define. Its impacts are impossible to quantify, as so many “n of 1” individuals make a whole wave of change in a different place, and in a way that is specific and empathetic to that place. This is movement building. The connections and innovations across interleaving communities and what it means for science and society is beautiful.\nMy nomination for the Leptoukh Lecture is one example. My dear colleagues Amy Steiker and Luis Lopez of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) – representing the NASA Openscapes Mentors co-creating and teaching common tutorials to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud – collaborated even as Aaron Friesz moved on to a new job at ESIP, where he supports the data community in new ways. And they included Allison Horst, a data scientist, teacher, and longtime collaborator who developed all Openscapes art, but who they had not yet met. They forked their systems for co-development and drew from our open community networks for a new purpose, just as we do when we build other social and technical infrastructure for science.\nWe’ve got more work to do. As Johnson & Wilkinson write in “All We Can Save” continue to drive us: “We” speaks to the collective, to collaboration, to community, to the relational work at hand. Addressing the climate crisis…will take everyone. We cannot, we must not, go it alone.”\nDr. Julia Stewart Lowndes\nOpenscapes\nFounding director\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLowndes, Julia S.

    "text": "Slowing down to speed up\nSomething that has resonated in the past months is the idea of “slowing down to speed up”. It takes a lot of time to collaborate, to teach, to learn, to try new things and change tracks, to tinker around with new tooling and workflows, to make and grow from mistakes. Being supported to slow down and invest this time is critical for the culture change we need as part of the broader open movement. And balancing this with all All The Things on our plates and with the ongoing pandemic and global uncertainty is a perpetual challenge. Identifying and supporting the need for time is a big part of our work."

    "text": "We are focused on supporting the missions of the organizations we work with by supporting their staff and scientists \nWe’re starting to talk about Openscapes as a mechanism that can rapidly identify problems and bring people together to solve them. The communities below include people within our partner organizations that work together to deliver work aligned with their goals to enable science and society, and are enriched by collaborating with the open science community.\n\nNASA Earthdata\n\nVision: NASA Earthdata’s vision is to make NASA’s free and open Earth science data interactive, interoperable, and accessible for research and societal benefit both today and tomorrow. This follows NASA Earth Science’s Vision: A thriving world, driven by trusted, actionable Earth science, and their Mission: Compelled by our planet’s rapid change, we innovate and collaborate to explore and understand the Earth system, make new discoveries, and enable solutions for the benefit of all.\nOpenscapes Update: NASA Openscapes Mentors have created “go-to” resources for staff and users using NASA Earthdata – such as the earthaccess python library and tutorials in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Our 2025 focus is strengthening NASA networks between Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), missions, training programs, and applications, aligned with SPD-41a open science, as we continue to support users through developing skills and tools. The NASA Openscapes Mentors developed this focus together during our Fall 2024 Mentors Retreat, building on the past three years of work together. We make progress through hosting regular online hackdays and coworking, where we develop tutorials, design and lead workshops, expand features of the earthaccess – a faster way to access and analyze NASA Earth data, develop open infrastructure through science environments (docker base images), cost monitoring and reporting for users, and open documentation. We are also planning the 2025 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort - we will lead this year’s Cohort in Fall 2025, giving time to iterate the program to support more science teams and users. Mentors will be leading other workshops this summer too; details will be at https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news and we’ll share about NASA Champions via the next newsletter. \n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries\n\nMission: NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. We provide vital services for the nation, all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management: productive and sustainable fisheries; safe sources of seafood; recovery and conservation of protected resources; healthy ecosystems.\nOpenscapes Update: Data and workforce modernization is happening at NOAA Fisheries – in many reinforcing ways through providing staff with the necessary skills and collaborative tools to drive changes in data and technical infrastructure. Over 2 months in fall 2024, 120 NOAA Fisheries staff from all six science centers, two regional offices and four headquarters offices tackled projects to improve or restructure data workflows via the Openscapes Champions Program. They made substantial progress on complex workflow transformation goals: Transitioning to contemporary data storage solutions; Automating large data-heavy reports with programmatic code and version control; Developing coordinated science program onboarding and operating procedures that are harmonized across NOAA Fisheries; and Prototyping cloud computing workflows for new data streams from satellites and ocean modeling. Now, the NOAA Fisheries mentor community is making progress on shared goals of data active archiving; infrastructure testing and governance; automated & templated reporting, and hosting coding & cloud training events. After sharing about GitHub governance at the ESIP winter meeting (slides; recording), mentors continue to use a GitHub Project Board to track progress, have awareness across the group, and continue growing synergies. Examples include a small group of mentors testing, troubleshooting, and documenting the new Google Workstations for Cloud computing, saving time and preventing frustration for hundreds of new users (issue); improving metadata creation for datasets and inPort, including facilitating meetings between research teams and developers (issue); creating diagrams and tables to help folks find the right infrastructure for a data project (issue); and sharing templates for manuscripts, publications, and research compendia in Quarto (issue; issue; issue; issue). This April we are launching our first NOAA Fisheries Data Academy with a cohort of 40 R beginners who will learn R for data analysis and visualization. \n\n\n\nCalifornia Water Boards\n\nMission: To preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California’s water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations. The Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA) has operationalized their values into process (pdf). \nOpenscapes Update: OIMA is refining their strategic plan that has included upskilling staff through the Openscapes Champions Program since 2021. We are currently advising OIMA as they develop a communication strategy and a mentor community to grow the community of staff supporting open data science and amplify this work. This work is not only for research teams but also for teams who manage contracts, as we shared in a talk co-presented with OIMA staff at the California Department of Water Resources last year. \n\n\n\nFred Hutch Cancer Center \n\nMission: Fred Hutch Cancer Center unites innovative research and compassionate care to prevent and eliminate cancer and infectious disease. We’re driven by the urgency of our patients, the hope of our community and our passion for discovery to pursue scientific breakthroughs and healthier lives for every person in every community. The Hutch lists specific Values describing how “our mission is directly tied to the humanity, dignity and inherent value of each employee, patient, community member and supporter. Our commitment to learning across our differences and similarities make us stronger.”\nOpenscapes Update: Next week we kick off the second Champions Cohort in partnership with the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab (DaSL); this is our 24th Champions Cohort since 2019. Through the Champions Program we will introduce concepts, workflows and examples to help teams surface their problems and ideas so that they can solve them with accountability and support. It is a remote-by-design program, designed for folks with busy schedules to make real progress. The DaSL team will support through mentoring and being a direct link between teams’ needs and solutions at Fred Hutch. Learn about how the Fred Hutch mentors are working on solving the lonely data scientist problem, and stay tuned to hear about Champions accomplishments this spring."

In November, we teamed up for “Getting to know Openscapes” at rOpenSci’s monthly social coworking and the discussion led to a post by Hugo Gruson, Stefanie Butland, and Ruby Krasnow on The Dynamic Relationship of Forks with their Upstream Repository.\nWe are making plans for the 2025 ESIP summer conference in Seattle, and looking forward to seeing folks there."

The workshop was at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with six teams of fisheries scientists from NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI), and University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s School for Marine Science & Technology (SMAST). It was really wonderful to meet and work with these thoughtful scientists in person, and to see them leave the workshop energized to strengthen teamwork and community-based learning around open data science. This post will focus on what the participants did and achieved and a following post will include more details about the workshop structure."

Workshops are a 2-day version of the Openscapes Champions program, and uses its Lesson Series to help scientists supercharge their research.\nParticipants attend as teams, and come prepared for engaged participation as a whole group and within smaller groups. Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open and collaborative work, with a heavy emphasis on R (including tidyverse, RMarkdown), GitHub (Issues), Google Drive, and Twitter. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites for this workshop."

    "text": "Our Openscapes Workshop at NOAA Woods Hole\nDr. Scott Large, the Ecosystems Dynamics & Assessment Branch Chief at NOAA’s NEFSC, made this workshop happen. He reached out to me after following Openscapes on Twitter and asked if I could do a 2-day workshop version of the Champions Program. He secured workshop funding, organized everything, and rallied six local teams of awesome scientists to participate at our workshop in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\nThe two best outcomes of the workshop were first that teams left motivated to focus on creating more deliberate, collaborative, open workflows within their team, and second, that they saw other teams as future colleagues, collaborators, and allies for fisheries open data science (!) and have plans to continue building this community.\n\n\n“Having a full two days with space to talk about how we work was invaluable. I was so pleased with how energized and engaged my team was throughout. I loved the opportunity to talk, work and learn cross-teams.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\n\n\n\n“Openscapes had a powerful motivating impact on some of the practices of open science I already knew about but felt behind the curve on tackling. Finding fellow coworkers who are equally motivated and already implementing these practices gave me a support team to work with moving forward.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the workshop participants met in small groups to discuss how topics covered applied to their work. They met as semi-random Breakout Groups to cross-pollinate across teams, as well as with with their own Research Groups.\n\n\n\nAll six teams at our workshop work in the realm of fisheries science and management, and as a whole they already have quite a bit of momentum in open data science. But many of these folks hadn’t had recent discussions around shared workflows and practices within their teams or how to onboard team members, and also didn’t necessarily know people from other teams that were working on similar topics or with similar approaches."

    "text": "What did we do?\nThe workshop followed the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, and we started off the first morning by setting expectations and the tone of the workshop with our Community Participation Guidelines and Openscapes Overview. We covered a lot in these two days, with over half (62%) of the time spent in smaller breakout groups or teams so that participants could focus on their own workflows and how the lesson topics pertain and apply.\n\n\n \n\nAgenda summary for the 2-day workshop. Hyperlinked slides available from the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series.\n\n\n\nWe concluded the workshop with participants sharing their “Pathways”, which are their plans for what to do moving forward. Overall, presentations all focused around social things like how to build open habits and momentum, rather than on technical things like which specific tools or workflows to learn. They discussed how their priorities going forward were about data workflows as a team (potentially as “Seaside Chats”), and building broader community and supporting each other locally. \n\n\n“I think the greatest value of the workshop was the time set aside to discuss our path forward as a team. We were able to discuss directly and extensively about how we can bring this open energy to enhance our workflow. We will definitely be trying the seaside chats.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\n\n\n“Turkeytime chats are coming (named for our gang of turkeys that hangs around our building)” — Post-workshop survey\n\nA few local meetups already exist that others know about and are welcome to attend, including the a Shiny meetup at NEFSC and the Quantfish woRkshops at UMass Dartmouth’s School for Marine Science & Technology (SMAST). Further, there was discussion about having a local #TidyTuesday meetup and starting a local RLadies chapter in Cape Cod!\n\n\n \n\nTweet by @ashleighjnovak.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s next for participants and workshops?\nWe’ll be following up and amplifying these teams in the coming months to share their progress, and we’re excited to share strategies and stories as they unfold. In just the week since the workshop, the Shiny Meetup has already met — with new members that have joined from the Openscapes workshop. They have scheduled meetups throughout the rest of the year, and are discussing broadening the focus beyond Shiny: perhaps tidyverse tutorials and even #TidyTuesday. Woohoo Shiny Meetup Group!\nIf you are interested in hosting an Openscapes workshop, please contact us: hello@openscapes.org.\n\n\nReflections\nI am really pleased with how this workshop went. Since the Openscapes Champions program is about developing mindsets and habits around open data science and nurturing cultural change in science, it was designed as a five-month remote program (with low-time investment: three hours/month). With workshops, I was interested to see how much cultural change and Championing we could catalyze in just two days. And I’m convinced it worked as we’d hoped; the participants were really thoughtful and engaged and left the workshop with plans to create community within and beyond their teams.\n\n\n“This was an empowering lesson in how we can improve our workflow, communication and morale, and work towards reproducible, efficient scientific methods.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\nThis workshop had a lot of firsts, things that were different from the previous Champions cohort:\n\nIn person, not remote.\nLocal community and research domain: all teams are focused around the same topic (fisheries management), and were local to Cape Cod/New Bedford.\nNot all teams had leads present; only 2 groups had leads present.\n\nThere were definitely things I would like to improve for next time. Most obviously for me to reduce some of the redundancy in the slide decks; such redundancy was a nice refresher/emphasis when folks were seeing them every two weeks as part of the five-month structure but was pretty repetitive over a course of two days. Also, I found myself telling rather than showing for too much of the time. When I made the slides last year for the inaugural cohort, I had fewer examples to show. But now I have so many examples from Champions and I need to showcase like I do in my conference talks, for example at FORCE11! So I’m excited to improve the course based on this experience and the feedback I’ve received.\nAdditionally, since not all teams had leads present, in the future we should focus time for teams not only to develop a plan for working with their teams about open data science, but strategies to also strengthen buy-in from leads. This is something that we should do regardless of whether team leads are present, really.\nThank you again to everyone who participated and are now Openscapes Champions!\n\n \n\nPhoto by Alicia Miller."

    "title": "We crossed the chasm at NOAA Fisheries",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Quicklinks:\n\nSlides\nCNG conf website\n\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog\n\nLast week at the Cloud Native Geospatial Conference Julie Lowndes gave a keynote titled “Crossing the chasm: change & resilience within organizations. Diffusion of Innovation theory in practice with NOAA Fisheries Openscapes”. It was about the awesome staff at NOAA Fisheries who are responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries provides vital services for the nation, all backed by sound science and a data-centered approach to management, to ensure productive and sustainable fisheries; safe sources of seafood; recovery and conservation of protected resources; and healthy ecosystems.\nClaiming we’ve crossed a big scary chasm is a bold claim, especially for a big goal: data modernization and workforce development across the agency. And, while the work is still hard and ongoing, this crossing is a story to celebrate. To amplify. To point and say “this is possible”. To repeat/fork in new places. To join. To grow. For you, us, to do these things. This is work that has been building for decades, by many dedicated people inside and outside of NOAA Fisheries, with many different job titles and contributions. This chasm crossing is a big deal because new data workflows are more efficient and robust, but they take real time to adopt and they take new skills. It is not easy in a large organization. But through steady work over the last three years, it’s happening. We are out of the early adopter phase and into the early majority. It is a huge honor to be the one to share this story, to be in service of the work of so many people.\n\n\n\n\nWe crossed the chasm!\n\n\n\nThis keynote was co-authored by Eli Holmes, the Open Science Lead at NOAA Fisheries. We shared how we planned, using the Diffusion of Innovation theory by EM Rogers (1962). And then how we operationalized, using the Openscapes Flywheel (Robinson & Lowndes 2022). We underscored one piece of the Flywheel: Coworking. This is one of the most actionable, low cost, immediate things groups can do to support each other and build new skills and workflows. We shared about how coworking is not a “fluffy” activity. Coworking addresses a known barrier to innovation and efficiency in organizations: silo-ing. Coworking is a set aside time when staff work on projects across typical team boundaries. This lightweight innovation ‘hack’ creates connections out of silos. The positive effects are apparent: staff learn of others working on similar problems and multiply their “solution network”. As an example, user support staff across NASA Earthdata – the NASA Openscapes Mentors – coworked to create the earthaccess python library, now the primary way to search and access NASA Earthdata from the cloud. The py-rocket docker image promotes cross-language (Python, R) collaboration across diverse user platforms for cloud computing in the earth sciences, created by a cross government-academic-non-profit-open-science collaboration: Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries, NMFS Openscapes); Carl Boettiger (UC Berkeley, Rocker) Luis Lopez (NASA NSIDC, earthaccess) & Yuvi Panda (2i2c, Jupyter). NOAA Fisheries staff have produced reusable (“forkable”) documentation for onboarding, saving time from weeks -&gt; days to produce unified onboarding and reporting for Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) teams across NOAA Fisheries!\nThe response to this talk at CNG was enthusiastic, with people celebrating this work at NOAA Fisheries and excited to amplify and reuse these methods in their own spaces – industry and small businesses as well as non-profit, academia, government. I met so many people through this work and we are excited to continue. Thanks all.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lowndes2025,\n  author = {Lowndes, Julie and Holmes, Eli},\n  title = {We Crossed the Chasm at {NOAA} {Fisheries}},\n  date = {2025-05-13},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-05-13-cng-conf},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLowndes, Julie, and Eli Holmes. 2025. “We Crossed the Chasm at\nNOAA Fisheries.” May 13, 2025. https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-05-13-cng-conf."

I also have a feeling of hope for a community.” - 2023 Reflections Participant\n\nOpenscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research. We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a &lt; 1 month program (1-2 hour/week for 4 weeks) modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach. This year we are adding a 4th week to teach our GitHub Clinic for publishing & project management (designed for collaboration skills for absolute beginners and seasoned version control users alike).\nThis program has a $95 value. We intend to make this program accessible to anyone interested, with sponsorship available through the registration form. Former federal and state government employees are encouraged to participate at the sponsored cost of $5.\nWe designed Reflections to be rewarding for people who haven’t been part of Openscapes initiatives so far, as well as returning folks who want some accountability and space to reflect on their workflows and plan how open data science practices can fuel institutional culture change. This will help you make goals going into summer.

We are so honored that Openscapes is a part of this effort, which will help modernize the way NOAA Fisheries collaborates on data-intensive science while boosting the efficiency and quality of their scientific products.\nFor the last 3 years we have been developing the NASA Openscapes community, working with staff across twelve NASA Earthdata centers to support researchers as they migrate earth data and climate data workflows to the Cloud with Open Science. We are excited to bring our expertise to NOAA Fisheries to help maximize their ability to rapidly respond to changing ocean conditions through Cloud and Open Science solutions. \nThe core Openscapes core team has 30 years of combined experience in helping federal and academic organizations reskill workforces by embracing Open Science and Open Data culture and technologies. We are also an active part of the broader Open Science community, learning with and contributing to communities including the Pangeo and Earth Science Information Partners [ESIP] communities (big data Geoscience), Jupyter, 2i2c, Quarto (Open Infrastructure for big data), rOpenSci and pyOpenSci (Open Source R and Python communities). We are active partners with leading organizations for open science training (The Carpentries, University of Washington eScience Institute, Turing Way, Code for Science & Society, NASA Transform to Open Science Initiative, SGCI/SGX3) open leadership and communication, and open source software (Mozilla, Posit, Creative Commons).

If you’re interested in seeing these infrequent updates in your inbox, please sign up here (linked from our connect with us page).\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news, openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/blog.\nHello all,\nIt is a new year, 2026. We are back from the holidays and already feeling the sense of togetherness and not aloneness as we get back to work. We feel this through the shared effort of many groups supporting science, supporting open practices, supporting each other. There are many ways to get this right. We are grateful to be a part of your community and this huge effort supporting science. Openscapes is here, funded, strong and resolved, and providing stability and community for people in their daily work.\nWe spent 2025 building and iterating with our collaborators. Many of our shared accomplishments are listed in this newsletter’s blog post. We tested systems we have developed, and met the moment by “forking” these systems to respond to changing needs with little turnaround time. As we shared in Julie’s Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award “Forking as a worldview” talk at the December 2025 AGU Fall Meeting – co-authored as our core team – this mindset and practice of “forking” enables us to be responsive and impactful, weathering uncertainty and looking out for each other. For example, “forking” enabled us to support NASA Earthdata users and NOAA Fisheries staff this fall, despite the disruptive government shutdown. We supported them through the NASA Openscapes Champions (Nov 13-14) and earthaccess Hackday on Dec 15 (online and in New Orleans); and leading 3x NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts Nov 18-Jan 21 (online; original dates Oct 7-Dec 11 shifted due to the shutdown).\nIn 2026 we’re continuing to support our current partners as we expand our collaborations with new partners. We will be leading a Champions Cohort with the European Space Agency’s EarthCODE project – our first international cohort! This is also part of the sustainability and business infrastructure building in the past year that we shared a bit about in Julie’s Leptoukh lecture.\nWe have upcoming blog posts in the works detailing the items in bold above.\nWe are currently planning events for 2026 – later than normal since we have just finished the 3 NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts that were delayed 5 weeks with the shutdown. Needing to “slow down to speed up”, we have made the difficult decision to pause our annual Pathways to Open Science and Reflections Programs this year. We appreciate our partners in cultivating the Pathways to Open Science community these past three years! We are also focused on “showing up at other people’s parties” and learning in solidarity with other open communities, as well as leading events with partners. Please check our events page for upcoming 2026 events, including community calls, cohorts, and conference talks, as they are planned.\nWhen things are hard, we shift to create and empower mode. And we do this together. It can feel overwhelming and not enough at the same time. But we are creating our own certainty where we can, and it matters. Openscapes team member and Liminal founder, Liz Neeley, writes Meeting the Moment, a weekly digest to help us keep current—but avoid feeling flooded—by staying focused.\nWe appreciate what you are all doing."

    "text": "AFSC Champions Cohort summary\nWe worked with Jeremy Rusin to bring the Openscapes Champions Program to AFSC, which included 8 teams. The teams consisted of 41 AFSC employees from 5 AFSC divisions and the Alaska Regional Office. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing and manuscript preparation, promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes, better collaboration with academic and state governments, and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. \nFor each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. It is essential that AFSC leadership, division directors, and supervisors continue to offer the support, time, space, and enthusiasm as teams continue to develop skills and implement meaningful new practices. Participants in the training also recognize the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Git and GitHub, advanced Google Workspace, reproducible analysis, collaborative writing). The AFSC can provide support for these needs by both identifying and funding training opportunities, and by encouraging scientists to allocate work time for expanding knowledge and expertise through free resources and self-directed training.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an Openscapes pathway written by the EcoFOCI team. The diagram summarizes how they used to share code, data, and files, and what their ongoing plans are for streamlining these processes and creating a team culture of openness and psychological safety.\n\n\n\nParticipants from the AFSC Openscapes cohort found the training transformative for their professional development. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors for the AFSC Openscapes cohort, we are committed to the community of support and active learning environment established during the training. We feel confident in stating AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication to all stakeholders. Everyone involved in the cohort looks forward to expanded Openscapes training opportunities in the near future.\nThe 2022 Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from January 28 to March 11, 2022. Cohort calls covered: \n1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, \n2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, \n3) instituting team culture and data strategies (Tidy Data), \n4) developing open communities and coding strategies (RMarkdown and Quarto), and \n5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training."

Their responses are summarized below. \n\nSupport from supervisors and leadership for building this and similar approaches into other projects. Cohort members were interested to hear from AFSC leadership about how the Board of Directors, program leads, and supervisors plan to support staff in learning these new skills and applying them in the future.\nEstablishing best practices across science centers for sharing large, confidential datasets with collaborators without having collaborators interact directly with internal databases. These challenges are not unique to AFSC and would benefit from cross-center collaboration.\nAllocating time for implementing open data science practices into performance plans by making the development of open science strategies and skills central to an employees’ priority activities and not an additional task relegated to ‘spare time’. \nIncluding contractors in trainings (like Openscapes) in the future, so that research teams can participate in full.\nContinued development of user-driven connections, communication, and collaborative learning between centers and between divisions at AFSC, including a focus on psychological safety. \nAdditional and specific technical training in RMarkdown, GitHub, RStudio Connect, public data sharing and team-building skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nA zoom view of the 2022 AFSC Openscapes Cohort!"

    "text": "Meet the teams and some of their work!\nThe EcoFOCI Ecosystem Indicators Team aims to streamline, document, and standardize survey data analysis and annual reporting of EcoFOCI ecosystem indicators for ESRs and ESPs. This team includes Lauren Rogers (@larogers123), Jesse Lamb (@jesseflamb), Kelia Axler (@keliaaxler), Ali Deary (@AlisonDeary-NOAA), and David Kimmel (@kimmeld09). Before Openscapes, the team felt that tight timelines forced the team to work “quickly; not always carefully” and that the Openscapes training gave them space to explore easier, faster, and more consistent ways to prepare results. The team created a GitHub organization to help them codify data and code, and more importantly, invest in culture change. The team heavily discussed establishing a culture of modeling openness, sharing early code, and asking for expertise. The team aptly phrased the latter as “hidden expertise,” as the expertise may exist, but on local computers and unbeknownst to their peers, forcing others to reinvent workflows and processes that were already established. \nThe Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Team aims to streamline the development, review, and publication of the annual Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports. This team includes Nancy Young (@nancycyoung), Brian Fadely (@BFadely), Rod Towell (@rtowell), Tony Orr (@Tony-Orr), and Erin Richmond (@erinrichmond). Through Openscapes, the team used GitHub, a new GitHub organization, wikis, and R Markdown to establish processes for preparing data and analyses, tackle outdated version control workflows, and improve on and offboarding procedures. The team focused on developing one SAR in R Markdown as a proof of concept. The team found that seaside chats spurred open discussion and idea sharing and plan to keep meeting after Openscapes. \nThe Groundfish Food Habits Team is focused on streamlining reproducible flow of code and data to provide food habits and model data to ESRs, ESPs, and stock assessments. This team includes Kerim Aydin (@kaydin-NOAA), Kirstin Holsman, Bridget Ferriss (@BridgetFerriss), Geoff Lang (@geofflang-NOAA), and Jonathan Reum. The team found that writing out the pathways document helped confirm next overarching steps for the group, that there were changes that needed to happen in their workflow, and that they needed to establish best practices. In an effort to foster a culture of reuse, the team started and tested out a GitHub organization and other avenues for collaboration so they can find the best platform forward for their unique team’s needs. \nThe Shellfish Assessment Program Team is focused on 1) improving annual Tech Memo and 2) improving collaboration on bitter crab disease reports. This team included Mike Litzow (@mikelitzow), Jonathan Richar (@JonRichar-NOAA), Erin Fedewa (@Erin-Fedewa-NOAA), Leah Zacher (@LeahZacher-NOAA), and Jen Gardner (@JenniferGardner-NOAA). Through the Openscapes program, the team devised a plan for accessing raw data, to data wrangling, to preparing tech memo figures. With their new GitHub organization, they had the tools to start earnest discussions on how to document their work. \nThe AFSC Stock Assessment Team’s overarching goal is to 1) create reproducible stock assessments and streamline reporting and presenting to Council bodies (specific project could be to take two assessments as examples: arrowtooth flounder and northern rockfish), 2) improve data to modeling to reporting for economic models, 3) create consistent fishery data sources across science and management, and 4) discuss of CFI implementation. This team includes Kalei Shotwell (@kshotwell), Meaghan Bryan (@mdbryan), Jim Ianelli (@jimianelli-NOAA), Ben Williams (@BenWilliams-NOAA), Chris Lunsford (@chrislunsford-NOAA), Alan Haynie (@alanhaynie-NOAA), and Anne Hollowed. Openscapes motivated the group to develop the Stock Modeling and Assessment Reproducibility Team (SMART), a supporting SOP, and a GitHub organization. SMART combines the two stock assessment teams and coordinates regular meetings and overarching goals for the effort. Through SMART, the team presented at the Informal Stock Assessment Advances in Methods meeting (March 1 and 3) on their openscapes work and conducted a survey in part to figure out where they could better support their peer stock assessors. \nTrophic Roles of Ice Seals RWP Team aims to develop a new Regional Work Plan-funded project to estimate the consumption of dominant prey by ice-associated seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas that would involve collaborators within and beyond NOAA. This team includes Stacie Hardy (@staciekozhardy), Peter Boveng (@PeterBoveng-NOAA), Heather Ziel (@zielhl), Michael Cameron (@MichaelCameron-NOAA), and Johanna Vollenweider (@JohannaPage-NOAA). The team felt that Openscapes created a space for members to collect thoughts, define a more efficient and thoughtful workflow ecosystem (e.g., tidyverse) to work within, and start planning how they can share what they learned and hope to implement with their larger group. The team worked on how their new GitHub Organization could help them work with external collaborators and instill version control as projects evolve. The team felt that working though this example project provided them with a universal framework that can be transferred to other existing projects. \nThe Fisheries Monitoring Team is focused on improving the Annual Deployment Plan analytic and report production workflow and result sharing with council, stock assessors and the public. This team includes Craig Faunce (@CraigFaunce-NOAA), Phil Ganz (@philganz), Jennifer Cahalan (@JenCahalan-NOAA), and Geoff Mayhew (@geoffmmayhew). Galvanized by Openscapes’ GitHub tutorial and an endeavor to streamline the onboarding and offboarding process, the team has begun moving much of their dataset wrangling scripts and issue tracking to GitHub. The team has also begun developing standard datasets for everyone to use in easy to access locations. \nThe Midwater Pollock Assessment Team aims to create a reproducible and transparent abundance analysis and reporting process for the management of midwater walleye pollock data in Alaska. This team includes Mike Levine (@mike-levine), Sarah Stienessen (@sstienessen), Nate Lauffenburger (@nlauffenburger), Sam Urmy (@ElOceanografo), and Abigail McCarthy (@abigailatsea). This team used their time with Openscapes to explore the best project management platform for their team and survey preparation, realizing that trello and smartsheets gave the team the flexibility they needed. The team also began automating cruise reports with R Markdown. The team next plans on providing a demonstration and presentation to the rest of their larger group as they start planning for their summer survey."

If you have signed up but did not see this in your inbox, please check your spam folder!\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news, openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/blog\nHello all,\nWe are feeling rejuvenated momentum and hope going into Fall 2024, and we hope this newsletter finds you well. We have had some recent big inflection points.\nOpenscapes is going to the White House! Openscapes is being recognized at the “Celebration of the OSTP Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge Winners” on September 19. This is a BIG DEAL and we are excited to share the joy with our community. Our September 26 Community Call debriefing The White House trip – which also includes presenting at the Dynamic Convergence Workshop - will continue the celebration as Ileana Fenwick and Julie Lowndes interview each other about their experiences. Please sign up here!\nNOAA Fisheries announced a 3-year commitment to open science as part of the Biden-Harris Administration Inflation Reduction Act. Openscapes is thrilled to be part of this work. We have been scaffolding with NOAA Fisheries for the past few years – through 10 Champions Cohorts and developing a cross-agency grassroots mentor community (read next paragraph about a recent publication!). This is such a celebration for the open science community as a whole, a high-profile example of what open science can look like in the government. It means open science directly helping meet the needs of changing oceans by supporting the NOAA workforce focused on climate resilience for fishing communities. It is also a huge celebration for NASA, whom NOAA has been watching and inspired by for their efforts in open science.\nRead our peer-reviewed paper co-authored by Openscapes mentors across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, U.S. EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, and the Fred Hutch Cancer Center - recently published in Ecology & Evolution. From co-author Anna Holder, Cal EPA / Water Boards: “It’s a short read and quite uplifting and inspirational and provides some more insight and what we’re learning as we implement Openscapes across organizations.” https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11341; Blog post\nOpenscapes update from Julie Lowndes, summer 2024 is another big deal. Julie talks about and codifies the Opencapes ethos, the organization’s structure, shares updates on new core team members Liz Neeley and Andy Teucher, how we all work together, and how we are igniting real culture change across science.\n2023 marked 5 years of Openscapes! We’ve been reflecting on our momentum and impact, and invite you to share what stands out to you in our Openscapes Survey. We’ve been sharing insights via talks and our submission to the Challenge.gov (the catalyst for The White House visit). We plan to share more at a submitted talk at the AGU Fall Meeting in Washington DC in December."

    "text": "As part of NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure and workflow modernization effort, Openscapes is providing workforce training and support in open science tools and practices for science teams and staff. This training and support maximizes NOAA Fisheries’ capability to deliver reliable, mission-critical information today and tomorrow. Through Champions cohorts, participants work on personal or team goals related to improving their data and science workflows, as they learn open science concepts, tooling, and examples from instructors and peers. Moving towards reproducible workflows and reports that involve scripting and templates rather than manual, difficult to replicate, processes is one of workflow changes that participants learn. For those particpants working on transforming their report workflows, NMFS Open Science held a 5-session Quarto workshop forused on hands-on skills in conjunction with the Openscapes trainings.\nIn addition, the Openscapes sessions are designed to help participants actively network across the line office and to learn the collaboration tools available at Fisheries to support this. ‘Silo-ing’, where individuals or teams work independently without sharing knowledge and skills with individuals and teams doing similar work, is a known problem in data science workforces and leads to inefficient and less innovative and robust work products. The Openscapes Champions programs helps individuals and teams move away from silo-ed workflows towards more collaborative processes.\nFor the fall 2024, the Openscapes Champions Cohorts had 190 applications for 120 spots. Participants were chosen to ensure equitable participation across science centers and regional and headquarter offices, with a preference for offices, teams and individuals that had not participated before and for teams involved in IRA supported projects. All six NOAA Fisheries science centers, Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, Alaska Regional Office, Office of Protected Resources, and Office of Sustainable Fisheries participated in the 2024 fall cohorts.\nThis cohort training is taking place over 5 remote calls from October 8 to December 4, 2024.

This cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from January 28 to March 11, 2022. Cohort calls covered: 1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, 2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, 3) instituting team culture and data strategies, 4) developing open communities and coding strategies, and 5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training.\nThe teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including shellfish, fisheries, marine mammals, stock assessments, ecosystem indicators, trophic relationships, and food habits. The teams consisted of 41 AFSC employees from 5 AFSC divisions and the Alaska Regional Office. All of the teams developed their skills for analysis workflows, report writing and manuscript preparation, promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes, better collaboration with academic and state governments, and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nFor each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. It is essential that AFSC leadership, division directors, and supervisors continue to offer the support, time, space, and enthusiasm as teams continue to develop skills and implement meaningful new practices. Participants in the training also recognize the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Git and GitHub, advanced Google Workspace, reproducible analysis, collaborative writing). The AFSC can provide support for these needs by both identifying and funding training opportunities, and by encouraging scientists to allocate work time for expanding knowledge and expertise through free resources and self-directed training.\nParticipants from the AFSC Openscapes cohort found the training transformative for their professional development. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors for the AFSC Openscapes cohort we are committed to the community of support and active learning environment established during the training. We feel confident in stating AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication to all stakeholders. Everyone involved in the cohort looks forward to expanded Openscapes training opportunities in the near future.\nOpenscapes blog post",

    "text": "Teams and their achievements\nThe EcoFOCI Ecosystem Indicators Team Aimed to streamline, document, and standardize survey data analysis and annual reporting of EcoFOCI ecosystem indicators for ESRs and ESPs. Before openscapes, the team felt that tight timelines forced the team to work “quickly; not always carefully” and that the Openscapes training gave them space to explore easier, faster, and more consistent ways to prepare results. They created a GitHub organization to help them codify data and code, and more importantly, invest in culture change. The team heavily discussed establishing a culture of modeling openness, sharing early code, and asking for expertise. The team aptly phrased the latter as “hidden expertise,” as the expertise may exist, but on local computers and unbeknownst to their peers, forcing others to reinvent workflows and processes that were already established.\n\n\n\nEcoFOCI diagram\n\n\nThe Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Team aimed to streamline the development, review, and publication of the annual Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports. They used GitHub, a new GitHub organization, wikis, and R Markdown to establish processes for preparing data and analyses, tackle outdated version control workflows, and improve on and offboarding procedures. The team focused on developing one SAR in R Markdown as a proof of concept. The team found that seaside chats spurred open discussion and idea sharing and has continued to meet regularly after Openscapes.\nThe Groundfish Food Habits Team was focused on streamlining reproducible flow of code and data to provide food habits and model data to ESRs, ESPs, and stock assessments. The team found that writing out the pathways document helped confirm next overarching steps for the group, that there were changes that needed to happen in their workflow, and that they needed to establish best practices. In an effort to foster a culture of reuse, the team started and tested out a GitHub organization and other avenues for collaboration so they can find the best platform forward for their unique team’s needs.\nThe Shellfish Assessment Program Team was focused on 1) improving their annual Tech Memo and 2) improving collaboration on bitter crab disease reports. Through the Openscapes program, the team devised a plan for accessing raw data, to data wrangling, to preparing tech memo figures. With their new GitHub organization, they had the tools to start earnest discussions on how to document their work.\nThe AFSC Stock Assessment Team’s overarching goals were to 1) create reproducible stock assessments and streamline reporting and presenting to Council bodies (specific project could be to take two assessments as examples: arrowtooth flounder and northern rockfish), 2) improve data to modeling to reporting for economic models, 3) create consistent fishery data sources across science and management, and 4) discuss of CFI implementation. They developed the Stock Modeling and Assessment Reproducibility Team (SMART), a supporting SOP, and a GitHub organization. SMART combines the two stock assessment teams and coordinates regular meetings and overarching goals for the effort.\nThe Trophic Roles of Ice Seals RWP Team aimed to develop a new Regional Work Plan-funded project to estimate the consumption of dominant prey by ice-associated seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas that would involve collaborators within and beyond NOAA. The team felt that Openscapes created a space for members to collect thoughts, define a more efficient and thoughtful workflow ecosystem (e.g., tidyverse) to work within, and start planning how they can share what they learned and hope to implement with their larger group. The team worked on how their new GitHub Organization could help them work with external collaborators and instill version control as projects evolve. The team felt that working though this example project provided them with a universal framework that can be transferred to other existing projects.\nThe Fisheries Monitoring Team was focused on improving the Annual Deployment Plan analytic and report production workflow and result sharing with council, stock assessors and the public. Galvanized by Openscapes’ GitHub tutorial and an endeavor to streamline the onboarding and offboarding process, the team has begun moving much of their dataset wrangling scripts and issue tracking to GitHub. The team has also begun developing standard datasets for everyone to use in easy to access locations.\nThe Midwater Pollock Assessment Team aimed to create a reproducible and transparent abundance analysis and reporting process for the management of midwater walleye pollock data in Alaska. This team used their time with Openscapes to explore the best project management platform for their team and survey preparation, realizing that trello and smartsheets gave the team the flexibility they needed. The team also began automating cruise reports with R Markdown. The team next plans on providing a demonstration and presentation to the rest of their larger group as they start planning for their summer survey.",

    "text": "NMFS Openscapes Fall 2021 planning team: Eli Holmes (NWFSC), Eric Ward (NWFSC), Helene Scalliet (NWFSC).\nfrom the Openscapes blog post\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with staff from different fisheries science centers. It was exciting to see participants discuss common pain points and learn from each other about strategies that could be reused across centers. Discussion topics included strategies to help diverse teams develop strategies for using GitHub together and organizing R code, as well as articulating differences between final NOAA products vs ongoing work/projects and how open science relates to both.\nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 NOAA NMFS Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples:\nDocumenting onboarding & offboarding processes. Investing time to formally document onboarding and offboarding processes (for federal employees as well as contractors) was a big topic. Both are important to capture institutional knowledge and critical to prepare both for folks leaving their positions and for new folks joining the team. Written documents help others get up to speed faster, and find available datasets, data description guides, and methodologies. It’s critical that they are easily accessible and updatable “living documents” for core or team processes that may occur infrequently.\nGitHub projects. While multiple tools for project collaboration and management exist, this cohort was particularly enthusiastic to learn more about Github projects. The cohort noticed that Github projects are easily used by team members who have different skill sets, job titles, and areas of expertise. Teams started offering other ways to contribute, including discussion boards, Github issues, and Slack. These tools enable asynchronous collaboration that goes “beyond the meetings” and can improve hybrid working conditions. GitHub’s Project Boards{beta} were release just as our cohort ended and Paul McElhaney (NWFSC) shared examples of how it could be used by NOAA teams. Some potential uses for GitHub Projects included:\nStrategies for community building. Collaboration is essential within teams and with external partners, but collaborating with people around new technology is challenging and takes time. Discussing next steps for carrying this work forward, one participant summarized it as “not just skills, also culture”, and that helping folks get excited is worth the effort. Strategies included show-by-doing (screensharing), co-working, office hours, and bringing down silos of people who are used to working with (beyond job titles). This includes sharing work earlier (not waiting for work to be perfect-ish before sharing) and building better shared relationships with Google folders.",

    "text": "Participating teams\nThe NWFSC Eco/Stock Assessment Team is a cross-divisional team (FRAM, CB and FE divisions) at NWFSC. The team’s will be working on analyses and visualization of fisheries-dependent and -independent data to inform both groundfish stock assessments and integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA). Potential projects include 1) analysis of ecosytem drivers and associated responses, 2) estimation of species-specific habitats in the context of fishing gear utilization, 3) incorporation of ecosystem considerations into stock assessments, 4) visualization of IEA indicator distributions and trends, and/or 5) development of a strata explorer app.\nThe NWFSC FEAT Team is from the Fisheries Resource and Monitoring division at NWFSC. This team will focus on streamlining data tracking/sharing/processing within the Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies (FEAT) team, as well as improving onboarding/offboarding of personnel, coordinating Pacific hake biomass calculation dataflow for stock assessors, MSE, and other interested parties. GitHub Org\nThe NWFSC Protected Salmonids Team is from the Conservation Biology division at NWFSC. This team will be working on improving data workflow related to protected PNW salmonids. We will be focusing on more robust data workflows: 1) better data tracking, 2) personnel on-boarding systems, 3) loss of critical connections with our diverse data partners when staff retire or leave, and 4) implementing more automated data workflows. Team members are from the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program working on the PNW Viability Reports that support the WCR Status Reviews for endangered and threatened salmonids and from the Genetics and Evolution Program working on the salmon bycatch RM&E program in the west coast groundfish fisheries. GitHub Org\nThe NWFSC WRAP Team is a cross-divisional team from the Fish Ecology and Fisheries Resource and Monitoring divisions at NWFSC. This team is working to coordinate sharing of data for marine ecosystem or life cycle modeling projects.\nThe AFSC Team is from the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division at AFSC. This team will be working improve data, code and report workflows for survey data. Data: curation, processing and dissemination, including implementing continuous integration. Code: improving collaboration on code packages survey data processing and prep, streamlining code development and sharing. Reports: automating reports, collaborating on proposal writing, and automating standard data products. GitHub Orgs: afsc-gap-products with onboarding page.\nThe SEFSC Team is part of the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR; http://sedarweb.org/) in the Sustainable Fisheries division at SEFSC. This team will be working on improving data workflow, automating reports, and collaborating on packages and functions for assessment model output and diagnostics for Southeast stock assessments for the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Atlantic.\nThe NEFSC Team in part collects fisheries dependent data in collaboration with the fishing industry. These data can be underutilized, in part due to their complex nature, and this complexity creates challenges for their use in reproducible research products. The team is interested in strengthening open science approaches to increase the value of these data by opening the door to new users who have previously been unable to use the data sets due to their complex nature.\nOpenscapes cohort leads: Julie Lowndes, Openscapes founder and co-director, NCEAS, UCSB, lead; Eli Holmes, NWFSC Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program, co-lead; Corey Clatterbuck, Seagrant Fellow at the California Water Boards Office of Information Management and Analysis, assisting",

    "section": "A plan to modernize NMFS teams with Open Science",
    "text": "A plan to modernize NMFS teams with Open Science\n\nContext\nOver the last decade, there have been rapid changes within the scientific community to improve the quality of science – these advances are not related to specific methodologies, but largely around scientific culture and collaboration (collectively, ‘Open Science’). Many of the techniques – including version control, code review, reproducible reports, project management, and leadership skills – have been widely used by industry and academic partners, but have not seen wide use in government. Open Science fosters a more efficient and equitable working environment, via improved team collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n\nWhere we are today\nMany federal agencies, including NOAA Fisheries, are experiencing a number of pressures affecting agency science. Examples include:\n\nNew risks affecting the kind of science we do (climate change impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems) and requiring new analyses to deal with changing environments\nFlat budgets amid rising operation costs and increasing costs of living (employees that leave may not be replaced)\nA distributed workforce (employees based remotely or across multiple offices)\nAn aging workforce, associated risk of loss of data and institutional knowledge, and need for succession planning\nNeed for transparency to enhance public trust in agency science and decisions\n\n\n\nOur vision for the future\nA number of projects across NMFS science centers have adopted Open Science practices to improve the efficiency and quality of scientific products. Examples include the development of FIMS tools for next generation stock assessment, the joint NMFS - DFO stock assessment of Pacific hake (NWFSC), ecosystem status reports for the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fishery Management Councils (NEFSC), and data products related to surveys (AFSC). Many additional projects are also deployed on the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (FIT).\nDespite these advancements, applications of Open Science best practices within NMFS are generally program-specific and maintained by one or a few team members. There is an urgent need to upskill the existing NMFS workforce with modern tooling and collaborative approaches to help our agency be nimble and tackle the challenges of the 21st century. Doing so will increase efficiency and build enduring resilience across science centers and regional offices.\nChange requires both structure, flexibility, and empathy so we can elevate our peers from where they are in their data science learning journeys. Similarly, collaborative team-based research requires non-technical changes to the way we work; these include documenting standard operating procedures, working inclusively within/across science centers and regional offices so that individuals across different types of offices collaborate effectively, and cultivating rather than reinventing products. Supporting this change in work culture demands a dynamic approach that leverages and amplifies ongoing work in global Open Science - and that is what Openscapes does, based on their team’s transition to better science in less time.\n\n\nWhat we have done and where we are going\nSince 2020, individual science centers have organized 6 cohorts with the Openscapes’ Champions Program (most recently with a 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort) demonstrating a demand at NMFS. However as not all centers (or regional offices) have access to the same levels of training funds, cohorts have not been evenly distributed across the agency. In addition, the training has thus far been limited to full-time federal staff and at many science centers, teams involve contractors and non-federal collaborators.\nWe are working on securing support for a 3-year national-level program modeled off of the 3-year NASA Openscapes program. Supporting Openscapes at a national level would enable sustainable adoption of Open Science workflows and more efficient NMFS teams trained in modern data science tools and team management.\n\n\nWhy Openscapes?\nNOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. We provide vital services for the nation, all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management. NOAA promotes Open Science in its work towards its mission: NOAA Data Strategy for open and transparent data and analyses.\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. They approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. Data analysis and stewardship are entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. The Openscapes Framework is team-based and particularly suited to the type of big team projects that we work on. Openscapes training is helping NMFS teams change their scientific workflows to work more openly, reproducibly, efficiently and robustly, to advance NOAA Fisheries’ mission.",

We have three synergistic objectives:\n\nDevelop a mentor community. We will develop a community of mentors across NMFS centers/offices. With Openscapes facilitation these mentors will learn and work together to strengthen Open Science skills (e.g. code and data-sharing and project management) at their center/office, co-create reusable resources for NMFS-specific scientific products, and collaborate with their colleagues via local activities and trainings.\nEmpower scientific teams. We will support center/office researchers to become high-functioning teams as they transition to Open Science and reproducible scientific workflows through the Openscapes’ Champions and Pathways to Open Science programs and other Community Skill Building Workshops. Cohorts can include teams from the same or across centers/offices, or be topic specific (like stock assessment reports) to strengthen relationships and shared practices.\nAmplify Open Science leaders. We will amplify NMFS Open Science leaders and leverage synergistic efforts within NMFS and NOAA. We will focus on opportunities and recognition for staff who support their colleagues, which is critical to upskilling the NMFS workforce, deepening leadership capacity within NOAA, and connecting to the global Open Science movement.",

    "text": "What is the Champions Program?\nThis is a workflow transformation & leadership opportunity.\n40 staff from across NOAA Fisheries come together bi-weekly to work on goals related to data science workflows. Do you want an opportunity to make progress on a project you are already working on? Do you or your team have a ‘big goal’ that involves changing how you work and you want to make progress on making your data and science workflows more efficient and reproducible (however you define that)? Do you want to migrate to new data and science workflows, like cloud-based workflows, but don’t know how to get started? Do you want to connect with others across NOAA Fisheries who are interested in Open Science, Open Data and Open Source? The Fall Openscapes Champions Cohorts are for you (and your team)! Make progress on those goals that seem so intangible and hard to get traction on by working in facilitated sessions with your peers and the Openscapes team. Scroll the blogs on what NOAA Fisheries teams and individuals have accomplished in the 13 NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts over the past 4 years.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that helps teams re-imagine data analysis and stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive communities. It is focused on open science and data modernization via biweekly curriculum that Openscapes has improved over 25 Cohorts 2019-2025. The goal is strengthening a teaching and learning culture within teams and organizations. This program is not only for scientists: admin, IT staff, and beyond are welcomed. Individuals and teams do not have to have familiarity or expertise in open science, data science, or coding, to benefit from the Openscapes Champions Program.",

    "text": "FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat does the “cloud” theme mean for the cohorts? Will the lessons change in any way?\nWe will be teaching the Champions core lessons and some will be tailored to help people think through what this year’s theme - reimagine data and workflows in the cloud - might mean for their own work. Participants will use the Pathways sheet to take stock of their workflows, and as always we expect and will teach to a wide range of skills and levels of experience with what “cloud” means.\n\n\nWhat is a team?\n\nHow you define ‘team’ is completely up to you and having one person be in the cohort and using in-between session ‘seaside chats’ to bring back the information to another group is 100% fine. That is common in the cohorts. In my first Openscapes cohort, I was the only person from my project. My personal goal was to use the Openscapes structure to help a team that I am on figure out how to tackle some off-boarding tasks due to a retirement. During my second cohort, there were 2 team members in the cohort and 2 not in the cohort. We focused on standardizing our data to get ready for our GitHub served data package. For the 3rd cohort I am doing, 2⁄3 of our team is in the cohort as we start to get organized for a major revamp of our report into a reproducible workflow. - Eli Holmes (NMFS Open Science, NWFSC, NMFS Openscapes)\n\nTeams do not need to be a formal research group; they can be collaborating in other ways. Team members do not all need to have technical or data interests, but share a curiosity and interest in improving something about how they work.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t have a team?\nThat’s ok, please sign up! We’ll help you connect with participants who share some of your goals or needs.\n\n\nIf a team is participating together, how important is it for them all to be in the same cohort?\nNot too important. Sometimes people feel more ‘connected’ if they see people they know in the virtual room. The activities during the cohort calls are not by ‘team’; they are in random breakout groups. Participants are expected to have ‘Seaside Chats’ together with their teams in the weeks between Cohort Calls. It’s more important that participants are committed to attending all sessions in the time slot they have chosen.\n\n\nCan I sign up if I have participated in a previous Openscapes Champions Cohort?\nYes. If Cohorts are oversubscribed, this would be discussed by a small selection committee.\nSee Frequently Asked Questions on the main Openscapes site for more guidance.",

    "text": "FDD Fall 2021 planning team: Gavin Fay (UMass Dartmouth), Andy Jones (NEFSC)\n\nCohort Webpage\nBlog Post\nFay Lab Manual Project of one of the teams. Widely used now as an example of a ‘Code of Conduct’ and on-boarding document for a team.\n\nIn September-October 2021, Openscapes led a 2-month Champions Cohort with Fisheries Dependent Data (FDD) Users, with over 30 fisheries scientists across academia and NOAA. These scientists were interested in exploring new approaches to working with FDD, which represents a complex mix of data and information collected to facilitate managing the region’s living marine resources. In the US Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of data and information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data can be poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. The FDD Openscapes Cohort was interested in learning ways to explore the potential to leverage FDD in new and innovative ways. It was part of ongoing efforts to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data and associated resources to their full potential.\n\nWhat did the participants achieve?\nfrom the Openscapes blog post\nThis was an exciting cohort because participants were focused on a common topic: research using FDD data. We had both data users (largely academic) and data providers (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center) in the Cohort, and they were able to share common issues and approaches that could benefit others in the group. Many topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 FDD Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples.\nSharing data isn’t the only way to practice open science. Many aspects of FDD can be confidential, meaning that it cannot be shared publicly or has special considerations for sharing. We discussed how there are ways to be open and collaborative even if you can’t share the data itself. For example, sharing documentation and metadata is a way to be open and collaborative, even if you cannot share the data. Making knitted (RMarkdown) documents that show data summaries even when raw data can’t be accessed is another strategy. Another approach is to provide a “toy” or simulated dataset with all the right fields so that code can be developed, then shared with a partner who has access to the confidential data and can run the code on their own. Further, location data can be jittered, vessel IDs can be anonymized, and data can be collapsed or summarized in a way to protect the confidential aspects of the dataset before sharing it broadly. We also discussed different definitions and examples of confidential data, and how folks treat it differently within an agency, and outwardly for users. Do we all agree on what confidential data actually is? Does everyone know how to handle confidential data properly?\nPsychological safety. When we discussed the importance of psychological safety, participants had great ideas for how to help foster more trust and safety in teams. For example, instead of “do you have any questions?” asking “what questions do you have?”, and creating spaces where individuals can be vulnerable to role model and encourage group vulnerability and trust. The cohort emphasized and reiterated that building trust and vulnerability takes time; it is built/earned through little moments and actions, not given outright - and it’s important for those that hold power (PIs, supervisors, managers, etc.) to lead by example and make space for those little moments within their teams. Others noted how important psychological safety was in this area where often data sets are not well documented and communication is essential to the proper use of the data.\nTooling helped teams collaborate - but Github and Slack are not the only options! Utilizing tools like Slack and GitHub can help some teams streamline and advance their communication and collaboration workflows, but that doesn’t mean those specific tools will work for everyone. Some individuals and teams in the FDD Cohort were already avid R/GitHub users, others were interested in using those tools more (GitHub Projects, and Issues, anyone?), and some individuals were not as keen on embedding a whole new software like GitHub or Slack into their workflows. Regardless of any individual’s interest or current abilities with a certain tool, everyone was able to use the Openscapes mindset to think about tools and workflows they currently use, explore how they are serving their teams (or not), and brainstorm ways to improve their data and communication workflows independent of any specific tool. Some teams in the FDD cohort regularly work with partners that may not have access to such tools, or even have access to the Internet. Teams began to discuss what to do in those situations and used their Seaside Chats to brainstorm and find solutions that work for them.\nCode of Conduct for Data? In our final session one group shared that with their Pathway they had thought a lot about codes of conduct, and how they could be used to be more clear about how to work with data, data access, and acknowledging contributors across multiple institutions. Other groups agreed, thinking that this could be another form of metadata that would be very helpful to refer to before, during, and after the project. It could also help streamline onboarding of team members as they enter projects, and offboarding team members before they move on. The question of “Who owns the data?”, from principles of anti-colonial science, was an important framing, and folks recommended viewing the recording of Dr. Max Liboiron’s recent keynote about research, communication, and land relations.\n\n\nFDD Cohort teams\nSee the Cohort Webpage",

The mentor program provides leadership and coaching training to help the mentors become better local leaders and to support their Open Science goals for the coming year. In addition, the program helps mentors network across NOAA Fisheries with others with similar goals and with the Openscapes at other federal agencies. The program helps mentors carve out time to make steady progress on their goals and to support their learning journey. Openscapes organizes bi-weekly co-working sessions for the mentor group, so that they have decicated times each month set aside to work on their goals together. The mentors are also local representatives for NOAA Fisheries Open Science, including Open Data, Open Source and Open Collaboration. The mentors help design and promote the Openscapes fall Champions cohorts, spearhead communication with with their local leadership, act as a point-person for interested local staff, help identify local needs, and help communicate, or potentially organize, teaching resources for their local staff. The mentor group is modeled after the NASA Openscapes Framework approach.\nParticipation is year-long and includes a cycle of Openscapes activities. Jan-May is focused on the mentors: they define their yearly goals and activites, working on coaching skills, and engage in active work on actualizing their goals. During this time, they will have opportunities to engage with the wider Open Science and Openscapes community in a variety of ways depending on their interests. During spring, they will have joint activities with the Pathways to Open Science program for marine scientists at historically black colleges and universities. During July 2025, they will have an in-person and hybrid retreat in conjuction with the ESIPfeds meeting, an organization for earth science data professionals targeting especially the federal agencies. Moving into early fall, the mentors will help plan the fall Champions cohorts (120 staff across the agency) which are Oct-Dec. During late fall, the mentors do not meet as a group. Those who want to participate in the Champions cohorts will do so while others will work on their goals independently.",

Coworking sessions by design have no agenda, are self-organizing and work-focused. They are less about “big ideas for discussion”. They work best when a few people show up with concrete things to accomplish or work on, and we get quickly into breakout rooms to cowork on these ideas. \nWhen you show up, these are some of the specific things that you can do: \n\nWork on your own code, writing\nAsk for feedback on something\nReview Mentor Calls, practice skills with someone\n\n\nIn-person Summer 2025 Workshop, July 21 in Seattle - blog summary\nNMFS Openscapes Champions Cohorts (Mentor roles in pre-cohort engagement, and mentoring during cohorts, October - December).\n\n\n\nMentors Summer Workshop 2025\nThe NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Mentors Summer Workshop is July 21. A hybrid event across timezones from Hawaii to the East Coast.\n\nPurpose: Have new opportunities for co-creation across our centers/offices, and amplifying our work since it is of great use for others.\nOutcomes:\n\nIncreased Mentors’ awareness across projects and progress on new ideas and barriers;\nBlog post following Summer Workshop highlighting Mentors’ work;\nMore examples for impact and shared slides.\n\nProcess: A facilitated workshop with some plenary learning time and Mentors deciding what you want to work on and share.\n\nMentors’ Social Hour: No-host dinner will follow at 5:30-7:30pm at Agua Verde Cafe, 1303 NE Boat Street, Seattle, Washington 98105.

The “Mentoring with a Coach Approach” will be a 5-session Mentor Calls takeover Wednesdays 1:00-2:30 pm PT on February 12, 26, March 12, 26, and April 9.\n\n\nSummer-Fall 2024\nTo kick off Mentors activities, we will focus on preparing for and leading three fall Champions Cohorts. Immediate activities will include scheduling and communicating the opportunity with colleagues, including sending emails, giving talks, ask-me-anythings, and helping folks sign up.\nKickoff slides\n\n\nOctober-December 2023: NMFS Mentors Cohort!\n\nThrough facilitation and practical training for mentoring, teaching, and coaching, Openscapes will help NMFS mentors strengthen skills and strategies to support colleagues with diverse comfort levels with software, coding, and data, while also strengthening relationships across centers/offices. Through this, mentors will identify and co-create on common resources and activities – such as code or databases for identical tasks or community developed standard practices – so there is less reinventing at each center.\nThe FY24 mentor cohort will start with a mentors-only Openscapes Champions cohort (facilated bi-weekly group meetings) during which Openscapes will guide the mentor cohort in discussing the needs and challenges for adoption of Open Science in NMFS and to develop actions to take. The facilitated meeting are vitual and twice monthly. Mentors will also collaborate asynchronously (e.g. Google Chat, GitHub). During the fall session, mentors will learn and practice coaching and mentoring skills in preparation for the winter Champions cohorts. We will also start identifying cross-center roadblocks that mentors can collaborate on throughout the next years.\n\nTimeline & topics\n\nDates: Twice monthly starting October 17, 2023\nTimes: 12:00 - 1:30pm PT / 3:00 - 4:30 pm ET &lt; note revised time\nLocation: Remotely, via Google Meet\n\n\n\nMentor Calls\nMentor Calls are when we convene as a group to learn and plan. Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our Cohort Google Folder; they are also an archive of our live notetaking. See Mentor Calls Skills for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nMentor Call Topics\n\n\n\n\n10/17\n1. Openscapes mindset for mentors: What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at NMFS mean? \n\n\n10/31\n2. Developing strong Open and Collaborative Communities \n\n\n11/14\n3. The art of teaching skills: running GitHub clinics \n\n\n11/28\n4. Supporting teams to tackle workflow change through the Champions Program \n\n\n12/12\n5. Reflections and shaping future plans \n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nSeaside Chats are for small-group coworking in weeks alternating between Mentor Calls. Topics are to reflect with your other center mentors in-between cross-center cohort calls. Note particants from different centers or offices can have Seaside chats together. We will organize our Seaside chats after the first mentor calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nSeaside co-working sessions\n\n\n\n\nWeek of 10/23\nBegin work on an Open Science Pathway for your center, office or program. Where are you at? Where would you like to be? Do you have the info you need to answer this?\n\n\nWeek of 11/6\nKeep working Open Science Pathway for your center, office or program with specific discussions of needs/challenges\n\n\nWeek of 11/20\nCross-FMC discussions of Open Science Pathways and work on shared organizing with GitHub\n\n\nWeek of 12/4.\nDiscuss ideas and plans for coordinating & engaging staff in Open Science goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary-June 2023\nFrom January-May through our bi-weekly meetings we are learning coaching and mentoring skills. We are learning valuable coaching skills - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. When listening as a coach, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem and find their solution, outside of our expertise. This is different from mentoring, when we do have an answer within our expertise. Developing these coach listening skills, what questions to ask, and when to use mentoring vs coaching skills, is the focus of our sessions; we are practicing coaching skills together to tackle common challenges and skill-build together.\nOur mentor-coach sessions are cross-government, and include other Openscapes mentors working within and across their own institutions.\n\n\n2022 July-August\nThe NMFS Openscapes mentor group is meeting bi-weekly. Current focus is on activities surrounding the summer cohorts at SEFSC and Cal EPA.\n\n\n2022 Spring\nMentors and other interested folks across science centers and regional offices met several times to plan and give presentations about NMFS Openscapes efforts to individual science centers and the NMFS Science Board.\n\n\n2022 January-March\nThe AFSC Mentors met bi-weekly during the 2021-2022 AFSC cohort.",

    "text": "We want to share our work in a way that people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it, or get credit for their contributions. For people who have participated in our programs like Openscapes Champions1, or Pathways to Open Science2, we want a robust way to add these to their CV as professional development. For contributors to our open educational resources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook3, we want them to get credit and visibility. For people who want to reuse or remix a slide from a presentation, we want them to feel great about it by providing an easy way to cite the presentation. To enable all of this, we created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a semantically meaningful group of selected research products. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement’s (CSCCE) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is not a repository!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide gives instructions for our use cases, with pointers for things that might not be obvious to a first-time user.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nHow to get a DOI for materials on GitHub\nHow to cite Openscapes publications\n\n\n\n\nOf course I want credit for my contributions! When we add an author’s ORCID ID to a Zenodo record, their ORCID profile is automatically updated. I learned of this bonus when I uploaded a post on which I’m a co-author, and then received email notification that this record had been added to my ORCID profile. Why is this so cool? An ORCID ID is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher with the same or a similar name to you. My ORCID profile is a bit like a CV. I use it to collect my research publications (not limited to peer reviewed papers) along with things like education and service on boards. Having it automatically updated is great.\n\n\n\n\nAssociating a Zenodo record with an author’s ORCID ID results in that record being automatically listed in their ORCID profile.\n\n\n\nWant to create a Zenodo Community? Play in the Sandbox first, where anyone can create and refine a draft Community before publishing it in Zenodo. Creating a Sandbox version forced me to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than my personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include or exclude. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear."

    "section": "Data and Workforce Modernization Is Happening",
    "text": "Data and Workforce Modernization Is Happening\nA common saying when people talk about modernizing is: “Technology is easy; people and social change are difficult.” At NOAA Fisheries, we’ve seen that real change is possible when technical and social infrastructure are prioritized together. Modernization efforts not only include data and technical infrastructure, but also the workforce—providing staff with the necessary skills and collaborative tools to drive these changes. One way we are doing this is the Openscapes Champions program. Openscapes creates a space where members from multiple teams come together to develop joint processes to improve overall project success.\nData modernization at NOAA Fisheries means getting information out faster so people can use this information to meet their needs. It includes data, reports, and analyses and making these more efficient to create, share, and update consistently, relieving staff time. It also makes it more transparent both to the team and people interested in the information.\n\n\n“I’ve already seen Openscapes change how NOAA Fisheries is doing things. There’s a national peer network for learning, getting help, sharing tools, fixing things, and innovating. I see this continuing to grow as the community grows and people see what’s possible. The emphasis on open, reproducible science will make it easier for partners and the public to engage in our work. Openscapes is contributing momentum to implementing tools that we need to do our jobs better.” – Phoebe Woodworth-Jefcoats, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\n\nOver two months in fall 2024, 120 NOAA Fisheries staff tackled projects to improve or restructure data workflows through the Openscapes Program. They made substantial progress on complex workflow transformation goals, such as:\n\nTransitioning to contemporary data storage solutions;\nAutomating large data-heavy reports with programmatic code and version control;\nDeveloping coordinated science program onboarding and operating procedures that are harmonized across NOAA Fisheries;\nPrototyping cloud computing workflows for new data streams from satellites and ocean modeling.\n\nProgram leads organized and taught lessons and skill-building workshops, led small group reflection time, and facilitated coworking sessions. During coworking sessions, participants could brainstorm and make progress on what mattered to them with others working on similar tasks. We can solve problems and complete tasks faster together in a social and collaborative way by reaching outside our individual work circles.\n\n\n\n\nZoomies of participants in the Fall 2024 NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts.

    "text": "How the Openscapes Champions Program Supports Change\nThe Openscapes Champions program is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program. It helps teams reimagine data analysis and stewardship as a cooperative effort, using modern reproducible science skills and tools within collaborative networks. These networks are critical in breaking down silos that lead to inefficiencies and duplication and that prevent peer-learning and problem-solving. The program focuses on open science and data modernization via weekly facilitated coworking sessions. The goal is to develop and strengthen a teaching and learning culture within teams and organizations. This program is not only for scientists; admin, IT, and other management-focused staff have worked on workflow-related projects or to improve management of technical teams.\nDuring the sessions, Champions learned from the successes of past Champions Program participants who transformed the Alaska Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Report process and the California Current Ecosystem Status Report process. Openscapes Mentors from across NOAA Fisheries offices also supported the weekly sessions with their expertise in analyzing big data, software development, and automation.\n\n\n\n\nThe Alaska Marine Mammal Stock Assessment team shared their report workflow to showcase what is possible from teams investing in shared workflows together. This is an example of the durable impacts of the training and work, several years after this team participated in the Champions program. Credit: NOAA Fisheries"

Participants presented their work-in-progress efforts from the program in the fifth and final call. The progress these teams made was impressive, representing a deep investment in skills and people.\n\nImproved Onboarding for Complex Science Initiatives\nAbigail Golden, Owen Liu, and Brooke Hawkins focused on developing a workflow for improving onboarding of new staff to a data processing pipeline for vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. They developed an onboarding workflow that would help new staff understand and contribute to the VMS pipeline. They first focused on improving the project README, developing checklists and building a visual of the onboarding pipeline. Siloed workflows and lack of cross-team awareness created inefficiencies in complex initiatives involving multiple use cases.\n\n\n\n\nThe Changing Ecosystems and Fisheries Initiative team improved the project’s onboarding process by updating the README file displayed on the code repository, developing checklists, and building a visual of the data processing pipeline.

They focused on deliverables for the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, using a template made by colleagues at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center during a previous Openscapes Champions Cohort. With dedicated learning time provided by the Champions program and Openscapes Mentors on hand to help, the Pacific Islands team quickly became confident with new technical skills to build documentation for their scientific methodology using Quarto and GitHub. The team also focused on communication, securing buy-in across the agency so these lab manuals can be used across NOAA Fisheries!\n\n\n\n\nThe Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center Passive Acoustics Monitoring Lab Manual, created collaboratively with Quarto and GitHub.

Risk-Plots combine many separate effects and exposure groups and the current process and code have evolved to include nine biological opinions. The team presented how they had begun work by mapping out their current process, and were then able to identify next steps.\n\n\n\n\nThe Office of Protected Resources team white-board map of their current workflow components so that they could identify next steps."

    "text": "Onward: Continuing to Modernize Data Workflows\nWe are working to modernize our data infrastructure and workforce together, and Openscapes is supporting this change. We are building on the momentum and products from previous cohorts since 2020. This momentum has led to collaborations as teams found they had shared tasks and needs, and common skills and workflows to be able to work more easily together. This led to the creation of templates and examples that accelerated the work in the 2024 cohorts. Beyond lines of code, teams and individuals have learned how to run more productive meetings and accomplish work via paired writing and programming. Skills such as shared and co-written agenda notes during meetings and regular coworking sessions, create a dynamic session where peers can ask for and get help. These new collaboration skills are some of the strongest habits that our staff bring to their work.\nThis work is not happening in isolation. Federal science agencies, including NOAA, have many mandates around open science and open data. The Openscapes Champions program is one of the initiatives helping to enhance transparency, collaboration, and accessibility of federally funded scientific information."

We were invited to attend the “Celebration of The White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge Winners”!\nJulie Lowndes (founding director) and Ileana Fenwick (Pathways to Open Science program lead) represented the Openscapes Team and our community at The White House recognition event, as well as at an international open science event called the Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop in Washington DC on Sept 18-19, where Julie was a panelist.\nThis was a BIG DEAL.\nWe’re so excited that Openscapes was recognized and wanted to share this moment. Why were we invited? What were our experiences? As a followup Community Call, Ileana and Julie “interviewed” each other to share their reactions to and thoughts about their experiences. A few highlights and notes below; you can also watch the full recording and view the annotated photo gallery.\nQuick links:\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news, openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/blog"

This was a gilded room with a big rectangular table, ornate chairs around the table and encircling the walls, and open science representatives from 13 federal agencies in attendance. Ileana spoke about how she first heard about open science in 2021, and how she found it so transformative for her science that she developed and leads the Openscapes Pathways to Open Science program for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. There were also Presidential cupcakes, with sugar seals you could eat!\nJulie’s “in the action moment” moment was walking into the building. This was the EEOB (Eisenhower Executive Office Building); after going through 3 security steps we were suddenly in the building and “unchaperoned” for an hour before our recognition ceremony, and encouraged to explore! It felt big – surrounded by history and structure, but we can shape what we do. There were fossils in the marble floors, stained glass in the ceilings above the spiraling staircases. We went into Vice President Harris’ office! We had aviator sunglasses (courtesy of Julie’s husband Elliot Lowndes) at the ready in case we met President Biden (we did not).\nOpenscapes was recognized for “movement building for kinder open science for future us: a cross-agency effort at NOAA Fisheries, NASA, and EPA”. Being recognized for “movement building” is significant; it is not an easily-measurable impact. Openscapes’ focus on movement building is having real impact shifting culture across academia, government, and non-profit groups. We help people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind workflows, and there are now over 1000 people who are/have been involved with Openscapes, including those who have brought this with them to new positions and jobs. We all approach open science as a daily practice, a way to work differently, in a kinder way and connect big challenges with daily work. This can show up in different ways depending on our situations, and the work that is long-term, ongoing, and intentional. Scroll recent blog posts to get a sense of this work.\nThe White House recognition follows from an Openscapes submission to The White House Office of Science & Technology Policy Open Science Recognition Challenge in Fall 2023, which was looking to recognize open science stories to benefit society. Co-authors (5 max) were: Julia Lowndes (Openscapes founding director who co-leads & supports initiatives); Erin Robinson (Metadata Game Changers co-founder who co-leads NASA Openscapes & helped scale Openscapes with the Flywheel); Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries Open Science lead, a 3-year initiative by the NOAA Fish Office of Science & Tech); Ileana Fenwick (Pathways to Open Science lead & a fierce advocate for HBCUs); Luis López (NASA Openscapes cloud infrastructure lead & develops open source tools).\n\n\n\n\n\nIleana and Julie representing Openscapes at the White House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition Challenge winners on the Navy Steps of the EEOB.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes made a 7-minute statement; we quoted Dr. Justin Rice (Deputy Manager at NASA Earth Science) and Dr. Evan Howell (Director, Office of Science and Technology at NOAA Fisheries) about the impact of Openscapes on their agencies; shared about the Flywheel & forking as the first step, as well as Champions & Pathways to Open Science programs.\n\n\n“The impact that Openscapes has had in the last 2 years is unprecedented at NASA” — Dr. Justin Rice, Deputy Project Manager for Data Systems for NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS)\n\n\n\n\n“Over the month or two I thought about the proposal, I met numerous people in the field involved in this initiative, and *everyone* was positive and supportive of the endeavor, which is something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in my career to date.” — Dr. Evan Howell, Director, Office of Science and Technology at NOAA Fisheries\n\n\nOur big ask was that people need to be paid to learn, teach, contribute to open source, and collaborate across organizations - there aren’t enough examples of what a sustainable career in open science looks like. If we’re asking people to change the way they work for open science, we need to change the way we work too – what levers can we pull with contracts, procurement, and reporting to fund that work and make it enduring. Ileana also underscored how important investing in HBCUs is, as they provide a huge proportion of our workforce.\n\n\n\nJulie and Ileana in Vice President Kamala Harris’ office!\n\n\nWatch the Community Call recording and browse the collaborative notes to hear more about The White House, our experiences, and the other awesome groups recognized there. You’ll also hear reflections about the Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop that we attended, organized by the Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA), in collaboration with CERN and UNESCO and with the participation of NASA and the National Science Foundation. This was a real international group and exciting to engage with open science on a more global scale. The collaborative notes also have Julie’s talking points from the panel."

Kourtney works as a biological science technician with the SWFSC Acoustic Ecology Lab. She is responsible for the lab’s data management and general lab management and maintenance. Her current research interests include using passive acoustics monitoring as a non-invasive way to study marine mammals in their natural environments. When Kourtney’s not working, you can find her spending time outdoors and hanging out with her dog.\n\n\nWhy open science is good science\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes helps us move away from the lonely science path to navigate the Open Science landscape where we can work as a team. Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\nOver the last two months I participated in the Openscapes Champions: NOAA Southwest & Pacific Islands Fisheries Fall 2022 Cohort. Openscapes encompasses the Open Science movement, which includes making your research and the scientific process more accessible, reproducible, and collaborative. Before starting this workshop, the Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab (SAEL) already incorporated the Open Science culture in many aspects of our work, but the Openscapes framework gave us the opportunity to build some Open Science habits that we were lacking and started our journey towards a more efficient and collaborative team.\nOver the 2 month program, I participated in a variety of weekly meetings, where I learned about these open data science approaches, developed my teams’ science pathway, and collaborated with other Fisheries scientists. My large cohort focused on the following lessons:\n\nOpenscapes mindset and better science in less time\nGitHub for publishing and project management\nTeam culture and data strategies\nOpen communities and coding strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Openscapes workshop participants on a weekly Zoom call.\n\n\n\nSmaller co-working meetings created space for me to collaborate with colleagues at other Fisheries science centers. In one of our first co-working sessions, I met with our colleagues at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center where we shared ideas for using GitHub and other Open Science tools. These conversations gave me insight on how others were using GitHub, as well as how we could move forward with it as our main home for all of our lab documentation.\nSeaside Chats with our SAEL team allowed those of us attending the Openscapes workshop to share our newfound knowledge and experience so we could make our science more open. During these sessions, we streamlined our science pathways, documented our methods through GitHub, and had general team strategy discussions.\nMy favorite tool I was introduced to was Quarto (an open source scientific and technical publishing system). My team and I quickly realized that this was the perfect tool for transferring everything from our messy Google Drives to GitHub! To put this into action, I transferred our recently revamped Adrift Field Methods manual to a Quarto web book. Previously, it was sitting in a google drive where it wasn’t easy to find and had accessibility issues. In just a couple hours, I was able to easily make a new repository, copy a Quarto template, and transfer the google document to a GitHub repository and an easy to navigate website! As we continued to transfer documents from google drives to GitHub, it became easier to find and share things, and the stress associated with file management drastically decreased.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from our ADRIFT Field Methods website created through the Openscapes Program. This is a living document where we can outline our methodology and update/archive specific components of our methods and hardware as changes are made. Credit: NOAA Fisheries / Kourtney Burger\n\n\n\nGoing into this program, our team culture fully embraced the Open Science movement. Openscapes pushed us to dive deeper into specific tools and strategies that will allow our science, methods, and lab culture to live beyond the current members of our team. Moving forward, we will continue to develop our GitHub as a living home for all of our lab manuals, methods, and shared resources.\nOpenscapes gave me a breath of fresh air as I learned that data science shouldn’t be tiresome, and that there are an abundance of resources and communities to help me and my team along our Open Science pathway. This Open Science framework, the tools we learned, and the communities we have developed will allow us to continue to grow as individual scientists and as a team, as we transform our science to be more open, reproducible, and sustainable for years to come."

Now that we host a second hub for NOAA Fisheries, we have centralized and continue to build on the documentation in our new website, openscapes.cloud. A key part of the new website that we have been working on is the “fledging” content - advice for users on how to transfer the knowledge they have gained in the Openscapes hubs to using cloud data and computing resources to perform “real” scientific analysis.\nThis website will continue to develop as we work on policies and documentation for accessing, using, and fledging from the hubs. Please let us know what you think by opening an issue.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{teucher2025,\n  author = {Teucher, Andy},\n  title = {Openscapes.cloud: {A} Central Place for {Openscapes}\n    {JupyterHubs} and Documentation},\n  date = {2025-01-09},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-01-09-openscapes.cloud/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nTeucher, Andy. 2025. “Openscapes.cloud: A Central Place for\nOpenscapes JupyterHubs and Documentation.” January 9, 2025. https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-01-09-openscapes.cloud/."

    "text": "In September-October, Openscapes led a 2-month Champions Cohort with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), working with over 30 fisheries scientists across four fisheries science centers at NMFS. These scientists were interested in exploring new approaches to scientific and data workflow, data analysis and stewardship, and project management—as it applies to the complex workflow required in analyses and reports involving diverse teams, data flows, and analyses.\nThis cohort followed one we led this spring for the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and was co-led by Dr. Eli Holmes, who had participated and has a long history of open science leadership and teaching at NOAA and beyond. This post focuses on what the cohort setup and participants achieved. It is co-authored with Eli, Eric Ward, and Hélène Scalliet from NOAA NWFSC, who coordinated the cohort, and Corey Clatterbuck from California Waterboards, who assisted. This opportunity is funded by participating science centers and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).

    "text": "NMFS Cohort setup and structure\nWe worked with Eric Ward earlier this year to lead the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) cohort with fisheries researchers from Seattle. We were keen to lead a second one to follow up and expand the participation with Openscapes, and were able to include researchers from four different fisheries science centers in the Southeast (SEFSC), Northeast (NEFSC), Northwest (NWFSC), and Alaska (AFSC). We iterated the Champions program based on what we learned from leading three cohorts in the spring, as we described in a separate post about Fall Cohorts. We were excited for this mix of new and returning champions and interested to support them to make progress on their open data science pathway, no matter where they were starting from.\nDuring the Openscapes Champions sessions, the entire cohort discussed inefficiencies, reproducibility and documentation problems and other team roadblocks in their current scientific workflows. The teaching component of each session involved training in reproducible workflow, team culture, and structuring open team communities that can collaborate effectively with the current and future selves.\nTwo guest teachers shared about their open data science efforts at NOAA. Emily Markowitz (NOAA AFSC) shared how the AFSC is using RMarkdown to automate stock assessment reports to improve efficiency, reproducibility and reduce report errors (slides: Data to Product Workflows). Chanté Davis (NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Region) shared about how the West Coast Region has approached staff training in R to increase efficiency in development of WCR reports and response to data requests (slides:Expanding OuR Communities). Emily said that with R Markdown workflows for making reports: “We will never guess again” and that it saves so much time and emailing to track things down. Chanté said “Don’t R alone!” and that R has to be in your work plan. She suggests approaching & mapping project management and workflows like a recipe: What is the end product? What are the steps to create the end product? Which of these steps can be automated?\nIn between the Champions sessions, the cohort learned the in-and-outs of using RStudio, Git and GitHub for team and project management with clinics and 1-on-1 sessions with Eli. Each team also met separately to work on their on goals for improving the team workflow during Seaside Chats (AFSC example), using GitHub Issues and Pathways documents as a way to organize together."

    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with folks from different fisheries science centers. It was exciting to see participants discuss common pain points and learn from each other about strategies that could be reused across centers. Discussion topics included strategies to help diverse teams develop strategies for using GitHub together and organizing R code, as well as articulating differences between final NOAA products vs ongoing work/projects and how open science relates to both.\nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 NOAA NMFS Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples:\nDocumenting onboarding & offboarding processes. Investing time to formally document onboarding and offboarding processes (for federal employees as well as contractors) was a big topic. Both are important to capture institutional knowledge and critical to prepare both for folks leaving their positions and for new folks joining the team. Written documents help others get up to speed faster, and find available datasets, data description guides, and methodologies. It’s critical that they are easily accessible and updatable “living documents” for core or team processes that may occur infrequently.\nGitHub projects. While multiple tools for project collaboration and management exist, this cohort was particularly enthusiastic to learn more about Github projects. The cohort noticed that Github projects are easily used by team members who have different skill sets, job titles, and areas of expertise. Teams started offering other ways to contribute, including discussion boards, Github issues, and Slack. These tools enable asynchronous collaboration that goes “beyond the meetings” and can improve hybrid working conditions. GitHub’s Project Boards{beta} were release just as our cohort ended and Paul McElhaney (NWFSC) shared examples of how it could be used by NOAA teams. Some potential uses for GitHub Projects included:\n\nOrganize and track data request tasks\nCoordinate on/offboarding efforts\nHands-on workflow practice and use using Github\n\n\n\n\n\nNWFSC Ocean Acidification Group’s GitHub Project Board, see other examples on the NMFS-Openscapes Wiki.\n\n\n\nStrategies for community building. Collaboration is essential within teams and with external partners, but collaborating with people around new technology is challenging and takes time. Discussing next steps for carrying this work forward, one participant summarized it as “not just skills, also culture”, and that helping folks get excited is worth the effort. Strategies included show-by-doing (screensharing), co-working, office hours, and bringing down silos of people who are used to working with (beyond job titles). This includes sharing work earlier (not waiting for work to be perfect-ish before sharing) and building better shared relationships with Google folders.\n\n“We want to change ‘our next steps’ to ‘our now’” - NMFS team member\n\nnmfs-openscapes GitHub Organization. Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and Em Markowitz (AFSC) have spear-headed the nmfs-openscapes GitHub Organization to help coordinate and give visibility to all the open data science work at NMFS — and beyond (see R-Govys. We especially love the Wiki, a growing resource with examples ofGitHub in gov andproject boards.\n\nThe NOAA-NMFS Champions Cohort was really a thoughtful and dedicated group, and are so excited for the momentum at NOAA NMFS. The following is a bit more about each NMFS team in the Cohort. And look out for further blogs about what the Openscapes team learned and what’s coming next."

    "text": "Background: How NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Cohorts Worked\nFrom October-December 2022, over 150 staff from six NOAA Fisheries Science Centers and two Regional Offices, as well as from the Office of Science and Technology participated in the Openscapes Champions Program, a professional development training program for transforming analytical workflows with open science. Through four Champions Cohorts and joint activities, NOAA Fisheries staff focused on developing a mindset for “future us” (Lowndes et al. 2019). We worked on developing a growth mindset to learn new systems and software, and practiced talking openly with colleagues and screen-sharing to improve how we work. We also learned about integrating new tools into our workflows, alongside real examples from NOAA colleagues from a previous Alaska Fisheries Science Center Champions Cohort of how learning these practices and tools in previous trainings have streamlined how they work.\nThroughout the fall, we co-led these four Cohorts as NOAA Fisheries staff mentors, fostering a supportive work environment that embraced constant improvement and peer support. In addition to the bi-weekly facilitated cohort trainings where we learned from the Champions Lesson Series and discussed our experiences with colleagues, we supported free-form cohort coworking sessions to support our colleagues’ processes, and themed cross-cohort sessions with topics like Pathways, Quarto, GitHub project boards, and attributes of “Agile” open science team workflow concepts (NMFS Openscapes Fall Tutorials). In addition to the cohort sessions, we as mentors met as a peer-group across all four cohorts bi-weekly to debrief on the week’s sessions, refine planned activities based on revealed needs, and also skill-shared tech and facilitating tips. This peer mentor cohort is a core element of the goal of Openscapes to support, promote, and elevate local open science leaders in order to support sustainable organizational change. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Zoom screenshots of participants in four Fall 2022 NOAA Fisheries Cohorts"

    "text": "What we did and learned together in our Champions Cohorts\nStaff participated in Champions Cohorts as teams, reinforcing the idea that we’re not in this alone, and providing colleagues with whom we could not only practice concepts and tools but implement them in a real-life work setting to get our stuff done. For each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the short few weeks of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and space to tackle “wish-list” tasks (tasks they intended to do as a team for a long time but did not have dedicated time for), value their progress, and shift long-term practices within their workflows. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals (ranging from documentation, to report writing, to developing analyses) they recognized  universal themes during the training: transparency, inclusivity, continuity, project management, and professional development.\nThe early weeks were devoted to exploration of the concepts of data and analysis pathways. Through discussions, teams identified common needs (through narratives and diagrams) to understand how data and analysis outputs were processed, stored, and incorporated into their own work. The process of writing out and discussing the entire workflow also helped teams understand the way the silo-ing of work (e.g., I do my job and then pass it on) led to low team awareness of issues (problems) and difficulty for the team to help itself (peer collaboration).  Common themes were collaborative reports, moving toward databases, standardized formats and version-control of data, and away from Excel files emailed or in shared drive folders with ever-changing version numbers in multiple formats that each are ‘wrangled’ in different ways for each team member’s task. Teams were also eager to change to data and analysis processes that would allow reports to be written in Quarto or RMarkdown, and shared and versioned with GitHub. Thus creating transparent and more easily reproduced reports where the data, data wrangling, and analyses are all explicit (via code) within the report. This would also allow teams to migrate towards a report in multiple formats: pdf, Word and html, all generated from the same source.\nTeams were not only focused on “tools”. Equally important were discussions around team communication: within the team and external to the team, for example, data and information providers and the end-users (e.g., regional offices or the public). This showed up as shared standard operating protocols, onboarding and offboarding procedures, and documentation. This was a way to put to practice the concept of “future us” for teams with turnover (particularly in remote and hybrid situations) and sustainably tracking inventories. Changing the nature and tempo of team meetings was also a theme. Many teams expressed that “coworking” sessions were helpful and eye-opening—these were not update meetings but rather times that people came to work on a task together, screensharing to expose and solve problems, and learn workflows from each other (for example: using gmail filters to manage calendar invites or GitHub notifications in a folder to be reviewed rather than streaming into your inbox).\nThe fall Openscapes training was a powerful opportunity for teams, and individuals, to step back and do a deep reflection and review their report or data science workflows. Adopting an open and growth mindset, they then worked together as peers and teammates to develop concrete ways to move toward workflows that embrace the open science ethos."

    "section": "Specifics from each Cohort",
    "text": "Specifics from each Cohort\n\nAlaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)\nAFSC supported 8 teams from 7 divisions across the center; 3 included cross-divisional partnerships. Teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries survey design and preparation, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, and fish life history. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of an expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence.\n\n\n“Before openscapes, our group had the beginnings of some momentum to create general, centralized protocols and analysis pipelines. The openscapes program really pushed us to the next level and gave us ideas of how to implement what we were thinking of designing for our group. Our advisor has supported us taking time to continue working on this organization and really cares about reproducibility. We are set up well to continue implementing our repos and shared resources.”\n\n\n\n\nPacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\nAs our first time working with Openscapes, PIFSC staff across all four science divisions participated in the Fall Cohorts. Three of the PIFSC teams gave progress presentations at the final session. Highlights including the introduction of the Protected Species Division Open Science Hub (Figure 2), a clear vision of enhanced reproducibility, collaboration, and team culture from the Ecosystem Sciences Division team, and an improved pathway for processing published datasets from the Fisheries Research and Monitoring Division Life History Program team.\nWhile some PIFSC staff have been committed to open science for some time, there is growing momentum to make these practices more widespread at PIFSC. Openscapes participants have been equipped with tools and a community to begin or continue practicing open science. We are sharing what we learned with our broader work teams, and plans are in motion to showcase PIFSC open science at a seminar in Spring 2023. Momentum is building to modernize our workflows and products. However, more capacity and training will be needed. In an email to Ecosystem Sciences Division leadership expressing support for future Openscapes training, Research Oceanographer Phoebe Woodworth-Jefcoats stated that Openscapes training was \n\n\n“hands down the best training I’ve had in my 15+ years with NOAA.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The PIFSC Protected Species Division team created a newGitHub Organization andinformation hub (using Quarto).\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\nThis is the third Openscapes training that SEFSC scientists have participated in. The Fall 2022 cohort  expanded this open science movement to every division in our Center. We have continued to build out tools initiated by previous participants, increasing our efficiencies and engagement in collaborative project management with GitHub project boards. The Population and Ecosystems Monitoring Division’s Trawl and Plankton Branch plans to expand their use of GitHub for cruise planning and version control programming to process and analyze cruise data (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The SEFSC Trawl and Plankton Branch team focused on “Where are we going and how do we get there”, and plans to do better documentation, use GitHub, which in the near-term involves setting up discussions to include more team members and set up collaborative processes.\n\n\n\nSEFSC staff are building repositories of standard scripts and incorporating better review of data products, leveraging the Git version control software in the SEFSC Organization under the NOAA-NMFS GitHub Enterprise. Our GitHub Organization facilitates collaboration and onboarding and centralizes our intellectual property under unified NMFS standard operating procedures.\n\n\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\nThis was the first time researchers from SWFSC participated in Openscapes! In her post for the NOAA Fisheries Science Blog, Biological Science Technician Kourtney Burger talked about the value of having Seaside Chats with her Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab (SAEL) team and connecting with peers at other Centers.\n\n\n“I transferred our recently revamped ADRIFT Field Methods manual to a Quarto web book. Previously, it was sitting in a google drive where it wasn’t easy to find and had accessibility issues. In just a couple hours, I was able to easily make a new repository, copy a Quarto template, and transfer the google document to a GitHub repository and an easy to navigate website!”\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)\nThis was the third Openscapes training that NWFSC scientists have participated in and as for previous Cohorts, this was a joint training with other offices. This provided a diversity of perspectives and helped participants understand the similarity and differences of data science tasks and challenges across the agency. A number of teams were participating for their second or third time and came with clear goals concerning improving workflows for the team’s large complex reports.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: NWFSC Ecosystem Status Report Automation team was united by working on reports with many contributors of maps, time series data that must be compiled into 20-page reports."

    "text": "Conclusion\nNOAA Fisheries is embracing cultural and technological evolution in our transition to open science. As part of this, we are taking strides towards standard best practices and secure IT workflows as it relates to internally and publicly sharing our scientific products, both in development and implementation. NOAA Fisheries scientists have put together a GitHub Vision Document and are working towards a GitHub Governance Team to pull what works from each Science Center. The result of these efforts will lead to a nationwide standard of more secure workflows, potentially more cost effective purchasing of tools, and more equitable distribution of these resources.\nWe’ve proposed additional partnerships with Openscapes via a 3-year grant proposal (with co-PI Holmes) that would further advance this movement. By creating more intentional opportunities (i.e. time and space) to seek and share guidance from one another, we inherently give our teammates a leg up on our respective starting points. When we critically and empathetically examine our workflows across teams, we foster an inclusive and psychologically safe work environment. We’re excited that the White House has declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science and to be part of this broader movement across government and science. \nThanks for reading! Please join us on January 26 at the ESIP Winter Meeting, where two of us - Adyan Rios (SEFSC) and Josh London (AFSC) - will share the success of movement building inside NOAA Fisheries, on a panel discussing “Better science for future us: Openscapes stories and approaches for the Year of Open Science”. Look for a follow-up blog and recording about this too!"

    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with folks across different parts of SEFSC, which has a wide geographic spread. Additionally, many folks have onboarded to NOAA during the ongoing pandemic and have not had the opportunity to meet many colleagues. It was exciting to see participants find alignment across NOAA missions, software, and supporting each other. Discussion topics were broad and also focused on the use of GitHub and Quarto for shared documentation. It was really inspiring to hear shared progress forward for more open and inclusive data science across the center. \nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. SEFSC has recently undergone a Center-Wide Realignment, and many staff have extremely limited time during this transition, resulting in cautious voluntary enlistment to additional tasks and training. With the 2022 Summer Cohort, there was a resounding sense of camaraderie and dedication to putting in the effort now to improve workflows for the future. Here are a few examples from our Pathways Presentations during our final session: \n\nUsing GitHub as outward-facing and internal communication\nSEFSC’s Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD) coordinates and conducts stock assessments involving many external partners throughout the southeast region, including 8 states, 4 US territories, and 3 regional management bodies. This complexity requires both the streamlined dissemination of assessment details and a dedicated location for communicating final assessment decisions internally. Skyler Sagarese participated in the 2021 Fall NMFS Cohort and built a GitHub page to track assessment details for coordination between the lead analyst and data compiler. This format was expanded and improved upon during the 2022 Summer SEFSC Cohort to facilitate collaboration between 2 SEFSC divisions and 4 branches involved in stock assessments for internal communications and distribution of details to external data providers for 2 Operational SEDAR Assessments - see figure below. The more staff that are trained to use these tools, the more streamlined and efficient our workflows become, improving employee morale and increasing assessment throughput.\n\n\n\n\nExample screenshot from the Sustainable Fisheries Division Assessment Workflow Team showing how they use GitHub for both an outward facing page and internal issue / progress tracking 😍\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating and documenting a communication plan\nThe Biology and Life History Branch within Fisheries, Assessment, Technology, and Engineering Support Division (FATES-BLH) documented their communication plan which acknowledged the areas where they are successful and identified areas for improvement (see figures below). Their branch has weekly meetings to strategize and track progress in real time, but is working to improve documentation of resulting products for easy and reproducible assessment inputs throughout SEFSC. Their team has been collaborating with SFD to receive assessment details through GitHub pages as well as collaborating within version-controlled programs, removing task redundancy and resulting in streamlined workflows. They are also working to document institutional knowledge and species-specific data issues, where the distribution of these details will vastly improve analyses and data inputs for stock assessments in the southeast. With SEFSC realignment, branches are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, necessitating efficient communication and workflows.\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Branch team communication plan which highlights current successes and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Openscapes team in their new pathway!  SEFSC Staff are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, but Openscapes has facilitated streamlined communication for all staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning improvements for reports\nReports and analyses for Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) are often recurring or require edits to data inputs throughout the process. These workflows are spread throughout individuals’ Google folders and collaborators have been communicating via multiple email threads.  The Openscapes Cohort helped this team to envision a better future with open science tools including data extraction code stored on GitHub that feeds directly into Quarto reports (see figure below). They also envision tracking current data versions with auto-generated date tags, an improvement over many versions of the same product in individual workflows that are difficult to track. The IEA team documented this process and improvements for the SEFSC 2022 Summer Cohort; many teams at SEFSC are working through similar issues and striving towards the highest quality data and most efficient generation of reports. All teams found common ground in this effort, highlighting positive impacts of open science practices that facilitate inspiration, expand collaboration, and synergize our diverse expertise across the Center.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem Assessment team pathway towards improved data quality through version control, streamlined communications, and automated reports."

The goals of this session were to hear from and boost a diverse set of leaders from across the US government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. Building from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, we hope to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning, and share open science stories across agencies, as part of the 2023 Year of Open Science as recently declared by the US Biden-Harris Administration. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. Stories were shared in a “Fishbowl” format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 50+ participants. This blog is co-authored with the speakers.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "3 approaches for the year of open science\nThis session brought together a diverse set of leaders from across the U.S. government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. They shared stories, examples, and concrete tips for supporting each other and our colleagues with collaborative, inclusive open science approaches, with the aim of strengthening channels for inter- and cross-agency action in the Year of Open Science 2023. This session builds from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, and you can review the summary blog and videos: 3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science. Those 3 takeaways were 1. Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary; 2. Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters; 3. Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change.\nThis year, presenters shared Openscapes stories and approaches following another year’s work mentoring, coaching, and teaching colleagues as well as listening, advocating, and informing open science policy at different levels. Their stories come from the many phases of open science movement building they represent: a first welcome, inside government organizations, “forking” Openscapes internally, and contributing back to open science. What emerged was real lightbulb moments and real-time interplay between panelists who have not previously worked together as we recognized common themes and learned from each other.\nHere are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers embodied:\n\nExamine the cracks; invest in real relationships\nBreak the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nBuild morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n\nWe describe these more fully below. And as we advocate for open science in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect open science with building morale and empowering individuals as well as with the higher quality of work created."

    "section": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships",
    "text": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships\n“Examining the cracks’’ was a concept brought up by Ileana Fenwick at the very beginning of our session, and it resonated with the other panelists throughout. Ileana designed and leads the Pathways to Open Science program, a remote event series of community calls and coworking for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. The first session, held on the evening of this ESIP panel, welcomed over 80 participants! Ileana shared that as she became empowered with open science, she thought exposure alone would be enough to attract other people to open science events. It wasn’t; there are many reasons why folks do not feel included in science and open science. It caused her to examine the cracks - why wouldn’t she participate in this program if she saw it in her inbox? This influenced the design of the Pathways program, with a deep investment in engagement. Ileana partnered Openscapes with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), and met 1:1 with faculty at HBCUs, to learn about their students’ needs and introduce her ideas for the program. Ileana shared these three pieces of advice, saying”inclusion is not an afterthought”:\n\nSurface level efforts are easy to spot. Some questions to ask as you plan your program goals and efforts are: What is your motivation for this work? Is it genuine? Is the space you’re inviting students to a safe space for marginalized students? (Do they know that?) It is clear when the broader impacts are written last. Inclusion is not an afterthought, your planning and process should demonstrate that.\nWe exist. If your efforts are not yielding diverse participation, it’s not because we aren’t out there. It’s because your efforts need to be tailored more specifically and intentionally.\nCenter diverse voices. If there are no members of your team from your target audience or your team is not reflective, this is a moment to step back and ask yourself if YOU need to be the one doing this work. Amplify and empower diverse leadership, support them, compensate them, use privilege to push the project forward.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSlide from Ileana Fenwick’s talk on challenging her views on how to engage. Examining the cracks led Ileana to see that that exposure to information is not enough, and this influenced the design of the Pathways to Open Science program\n\n\nLater, Corey Clatterbuck described the momentum at the California Water Boards following an Openscapes Cohort she and Anna Holder co-led in 2022. They knew they wanted to “fork” the Openscapes curriculum to adapt it to the needs of their colleagues, so they examined the cracks using results of an internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey with Water Boards employees. Corey and Anna were surprised by the results and, like Ileana, designed their programming to meet these needs. The results showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (image below, top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (image below, bottom half). In short, people were more interested in learning how to do things in their job (goal-oriented), than learning specific software (tool-oriented). From this, the design of their Cohort emphasized the human over technical approach to open science to reach the majority of Water Boards colleagues who might be interested in open science. They increased the length of each call from 1.5 hours to 2 hours, and added a new module on documentation to replace the one on coding-strategies.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults from the California Water Boards internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (bottom half). Examining these cracks influenced how Clatterbuck and Holder forked and designed the Champions Program at the California Water Boards. (slide from Clatterbuck)\n\n\nIleana’s approach of “Examining the cracks” also caught Cassie Nickles’ ear. She is a Mentor with NASA Openscapes, a community that supports researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud. Cassie and her colleagues across other NASA Earthdata data centers are co-creating common tutorials, a review & reuse process, and as well as community of practice for teaching, mentoring, and facilitation for NASA Earthdata Cloud. As she was onboarding into her current role, Cassie became overwhelmed by the steps and processes required by end users to access and use NASA Earthdata. She figured if she was confused, others might be too and wanted to help simplify navigating the complicated systems.\n\n\n“The data analysis needed for the pressing problems we face should not be limited by the complexity of the underlying systems or a lack of computer engineering skills.” —Luis Lopez, NSIDC\n\n\nCassie and Openscapes Mentor-colleague Catalina Oaida Taglialatela made Cheatsheets with clickable icons that lead to tutorials for NASA Earthdata Cloud researchers! Having filled some gaps, Cassie is now recognizing more cracks moving forward: how do we get these resources in front of the folks they’re intended for?"

    "section": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration",
    "text": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nErin Robinson opened the session saying that solutions to large-scale environmental and social challenges require radical collaboration, but have been limited by the hero model, where science is competitive, siloed, and rewards an individual hero, often a white man. She said we together are changing this story. We do this by welcoming people where they are and through creative approaches that blend methods from open source software development, mentoring, coaching, and art.\nReflecting as a Mentor at NOAA Fisheries supporting 6 Openscapes cohorts (240 staff) in 2022, Josh London said that “collaboration is something we’re never taught.” Individuality is instilled in grad school and we never have a chance to change this through “business as usual.” We need the space and place to relearn. Don’t spend your time trying to solve things yourself. Learn together first! It’s ok to ask for help early. Adyan Rios is also a NOAA Fisheries Mentor, who is helping develop a learning culture at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center through leading “Surf Sessions” where colleagues cowork remotely and share what they know. Adyan echoed this need for radical collaboration, saying that it’s radical because it means being vulnerable. It means people sharing things they haven’t figured out yet, while they’re still messy. Or share a cool thing you learned, like a keyboard shortcut. If you just learned it, chances are someone in your community didn’t know it yet either. Sharing makes their day a little better and make their work more efficient. This harkens back to Cassie creating cheatsheets to share what she figured out to help others.\n\n\n“Team collaboration is not something that we’ve all learned from the beginning. In grad school it’s instilled in us this idea that anything meaningful that we do in science is supposed to be done by us as individuals.” —Josh London, NOAA AFSC\n\n\n\n\n\n“This mindset and practice [of learning together first] has been revolutionary for us at NOAA.” —Adyan Rios, NOAA SEFSC\n\n\nBreaking the hero model is something that Luis Lopez has been thinking about too. He shared that as a software engineer, something he has learned through the NASA Openscapes Mentors community is to empathize with researchers and not expect that software alone is the hero. The key is to really understand learners and researchers, get to know them and see how they work and where they are stuck. Working with his NASA Mentor colleagues, Luis identified that there were many steps involved before researchers could be hands-on with data in the cloud, and was intent on reducing that “time to science”. Luis has led development of the earthaccess python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data, enabling a researcher to get to the science with four lines of Python code, instead of running command line code that saves a hidden .netrc file to the user’s computer and requires reactivation after one hour. Collaborating with other Mentors has been critical here – again breaking the hero model – as Cassie’s Cheatsheets helped visualize all the steps previously involved that were cumbersome for scientists."

    "text": "Build morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n“How to make learning part of your job” and “When do you carve out time to learn” are questions that come up frequently, as they did here. Pointing to examples of how other individuals and agencies do this has been super powerful: it is negotiated with supervisors at NOAA to be included in Individual Work Plans, and the NASA Earthdata Mentors are a fantastic example of the power of high-level support for learning. The NASA Mentors shared how the Mentor community has been able to learn and collaborate together over the past two years. This was because their time was approved at a high level, by NASA policy and by their managers. This approved time has given space for them to first share and listen, find the common, and then build together, reuse, and amplify.\n\n\n“Learning builds morale: it gives people an opportunity to change workflows, learn new skills, improve the culture, and take ownershipof that” —Josh London, NOAA AFSC\n\n\nWe’re seeing some of this trickle out beyond the Openscapes curriculum. Josh London talked about how we often focus on the shiny new tools (python, R, Quarto, GitHub) but it’s the culture shifts that are the real meaningful change. He said it’s so encouraging to see in a calendar invite for a meeting that someone’s already initiated an agenda in a shared document and that there are multiple people contributing notes there at the same time. Additionally, learning to use tools like GitHub for shared “todo” lists and better project management for teams has increased morale for NOAA Fisheries teams. Teams are also using these tools for more inclusive communication to onboard other team members to their projects, passing forward this increased morale that comes from learning together.\nLoneliness during the Pandemic was mentioned several times - Adyan, Cassie, Corey, and Ileana all onboarded to their current roles during the pandemic. They noted that shared practices like coworking along with collaborating asynchronously with GitHub and Google Docs helped them feel less alone and build real connections with their colleagues. And, it helped them learn skills they needed to do their jobs. They saw that these skills would help other colleagues as well, so they have dedicated time to teaching and supporting colleagues, and advocating for learning time from supervisors.\n\n\n“Not everyone needs the same learning curve; we can send down a rope and help others get to where they need to be sooner.” —Adyan Rios, NOAA SEFSC\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe California Water Boards Openscapes Cohort emphasized psychological safety and culture, uniting data strategies, and documentation to create a welcoming environment, build community, and reduce loneliness in learning new skills.

ESIP is a great place to make those connections across agencies and convening these sessions is an effective way to move us all forward together. Open science isn’t the ultimate goal. The vision is what’s possible because of open science: climate solutions, social justice, and democracy. As we advocate in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect it not just to the higher efficiency and quality of work that is produced, but especially with higher team morale and empowerment of individuals to change their institutional culture."

    "text": "Cross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog\nOn July 21, 2025, NOAA Fisheries (aka National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS) staff and collaborators came together for the NMFS Openscapes Summer Workshop—a hybrid retreat designed to reflect on progress, share lessons, co-create, and deepen our collective commitment to open, reproducible science.\nThe day was intentionally structured to support collaboration across time zones, with morning sessions aligned to the East Coast and afternoon sessions focused on the West Coast, including Alaska and Hawai‘i. Each co-creation block began with a “wise standup” to establish the project and crowdsource knowledge in the room, followed by blocks of coworking time. A full-group plenary brought everyone together mid-day, where NMFS Openscapes participants shared how their work practices and workflows had evolved, providing an opportunity to learn from each other.\nThis year’s workshop marked a critical juncture. As NOAA Fisheries advances its shift to cloud infrastructure, participants are engaging with what that truly requires—not just uploading data, but rethinking how scientific work is documented, organized, and shared. What emerged was clear: mentorship and collaboration are a form of infrastructure, one that enables long-term transformation and upholds our scientific integrity values."

    "text": "Crossing the Chasm: The Journey Toward Reproducibility\nA recurring theme throughout the day was the ongoing transition from legacy, siloed workflows to open, reproducible, and cloud-compatible practices. These innovations, while forward-moving, are at times disruptive. The plenary provided a time for reflecting on and sharing lessons learned from across NOAA Fisheries about these transitions.\nDuring the first half of the plenary session, Eli Holmes, Lead of NOAA Fisheries Open Science, provided a set of concepts on organizational change: diffusion of innovation and the adaptation of that work by Geoffrey Moore, crossing the chasm. Eli viewed these ideas as a set of tools, alongside GitHub or other software tools, that help her understand and explain her own work. She demonstrated this approach by reflecting on the evolution from her own decision to learn to use GitHub to its adoption across NMFS today.\nAs Eli and a few initial colleagues incorporated GitHub into their own workflows for sharing models, they began to envision broad use across NMFS. Eli likened this early GitHub work to the first person who thought a wolf could be trained to herd sheep—a wild, disruptive idea at first, met with skepticism from those focused on raising sheep, not training puppies.\n\n\n\n\nA slide from Eli Holmes’ presentation illustrating “crossing the chasm” with the metaphor of using dogs to herd sheep.\n\n\n\nMost people in an organization would not consider themselves eager to train a puppy or dramatically change their workflows. This is the chasm between early adopters and everyone else. Eli emphasized that for an idea to diffuse into the larger organization, early adopters must be aware that there is a chasm. Being aware of the chasm and that it is a normal part of these kinds of change can reduce frustration in the early adopters, who often wonder why others aren’t as eager to make a change as they are.\nBeing aware is not enough. Crossing the chasm requires the initial ideas to be shaped into something that solves a real problem for the community and is practical and easy to adopt. Continuing with the sheepdog metaphor, early adopters put in the patience and obsession to turn that “puppy” into a skilled sheepdog. Looking back, Eli highlighted how those early meetings and experiments with a small group of early adopters, and slow progress over time, were the essential work required to cross the chasm and support and move from eager adopters to those more hesitant to change.\nUltimately, NMFS successfully crossed the GitHub adoption chasm. The NMFS’s early GitHub experiments evolved into GitHub Enterprise licences that are available equitably across centers, processes are documented, and a GitHub Governance team is established at NOAA Fisheries. This retrospective anecdote provided encouragement to those among us who are innovators and early adopters. We hope that some might take these concepts and ‘fork them’ to understand, troubleshoot, and communicate other technology transitions.\nIn the second half of the plenary, mentors used the Moments, Memories, Meaning approach to eliciting stories, to highlight progress through NMFS Openscapes. One mentor shared experiences of the lag between having the tools available and gaining traction with their team to use them. Another mentor described how automating stock assessment reports, one section at a time, over multiple years, eventually freed up time to focus not just on delivering outputs, but improving the workflow behind them. A third mentor knew they had reached a tipping point when it was easier to do things the new way, in Quarto, than the old PowerPoint way.\n\n\n\n\nPlenary presentations. Hem Nalini Morzaria at the podium. Kathryn Doering’s slide “How Openscapes has changed my work life for the better”.\n\n\n\nWithout documentation, automation, and shared protocols, scientific work remains stuck in desktop-bound silos. But with them, it becomes portable, scalable, and future-ready. The lesson from these stories is clear: transformation takes time. But each script shared, repo forked, and quarto book published is a step toward workflows that don’t just work locally—they work across teams, in the cloud, and for the long haul."

    "text": "Project Progress During Co-Creation Blocks\nDuring the morning and afternoon co-creation blocks, participants worked on active projects with the support of Openscapes mentors and peers. These sessions were a twist on the agile format stand-ups. Participants shared their problems quickly, the entire audience asked clarifying questions, and then a small group had a short breakout on each problem to identify more resources, advice, or questions. With this quickly crowdsourced information, the teams interested in working on each project then split off for dedicated time to make tangible progress.\n\n\n\n\nWorking together during a co-creation block.\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of projects that were worked on during the workshop:\n1. Centralizing NMFS Branding Assets\nParticipants worked on centralizing NMFS branding assets for use across scientific outputs. This included referencing theNOAA-NMFS-Brand-Resources GitHub repository, which houses reproducible elements like colors, fonts, and layout guidance. The goal is to support consistency across reports, websites, and Quarto projects.\n2. Decision Tree for Moving On-Prem Data to the Cloud\nThis group focused on outlining when and how to move datasets from on-premise storage to the cloud. The resulting decision tree is being developed as part of the NMFS Cloud Data Resource Book. This project was identified as foundational to cloud readiness.\n3. Research Compendium for PIFSC Marine Turtle Camps and Beyond\nThis team focused on adapting a research compendium template to the needs of marine turtle fieldwork and other data-collection-intensive projects. Their work builds on existing compendium structures to enable reuse and reproducibility across related efforts.\n4. Applying Quarto for Automating and Templating Reports\nThis project explored how Quarto can be used to generate repeatable report templates. The group investigated how to streamline authoring scientific reports across Centers by using parameterized templates and integrating them into version-controlled workflows. An example workflow was tested during the co-creation time. This work builds on the already advanced-level Quarto applications developed by the mentors and their colleagues.\n5. Open Science Tools Decision Tree\nThis group worked on developing guidance around which tools to use (e.g., GitHub, Quarto, RStudio) for different stages of scientific work. Their goal was to make open science workflows easier to adopt, particularly for those new to coding or version control.\n6. Central Locations for Open Science Tools at PIFSC\nThis team focused on designing a more discoverable and centralized place to access open science resources within PIFSC. Their intent was to “fork” the model used by other groups to curate tools and templates for broader visibility and reuse across the center.\n7. “Code Cleanup” of R packages in the National Stock Assessment Program\nThe group who maintains or contributes to the centralized asar and stockplotr R packages for automated stock assessment reports used the time for a collaborative code cleanup."

Participants emphasized that being “cloud ready” requires more than storage space—it depends on well-documented, reproducible workflows that enable others to understand, reuse, and trust the work. Through the co-creation blocks, they identified actionable gaps in training and decision-making, underscoring the need to invest in collaboration-centered approaches to technical change.\nKey needs emerged as NOAA Fisheries looks ahead:\n\nBuild pathways, not just tools, especially for complex workflows involving cloud storage and access\nTailor documentation and training to NOAA scientists, with their real-world collaboration and compliance needs in mind\nBroaden the mentor community to include data stewards, analysts, managers, and IT staff\nAmplify successful projects and template solutions across centers\nAcknowledge and support the “invisible work” of documentation, onboarding, and peer coaching\n\nFrom the many moments shared over the course of the day, a real shift occurs when reproducible workflows are not just better—they’re the obvious choice. The workshop highlighted how NMFS Openscapes is enabling NOAA Fisheries to lead by example—putting core scientific values into practice through open workflows, shared learning, and intentional collaboration. \n\n\n\n\nJosh London, Eli Holmes, Jon Peake, Erin Robinson, Julie Lowndes"

    "section": "Growing a mentors community",
    "text": "Growing a mentors community\nWe started as a grass-roots mentors community in 2021, and together have coordinated and co-led 10 Openscapes Champions cohorts (like those held at AFSC, and across other NOAA Fisheries) to support over 400 staff with open data science skills, building connections across NOAA Fisheries from 2021 to 2022. These Openscapes Champions cohorts provided the foundation for participants to form collaborative working groups. For example, participants from the NWFSC, AFSC, and OST Openscapes Champions cohorts formed the NMFS GitHub Governance Team (GGT) in early 2023 in response to the recognition of the explosive growth and importance of GitHub for reproducible science and for documenting work involving data and code. The early GGT organizers recognized the importance of a new governance structure that involved both the end-user scientists and IT. The Openscapes Champions program was also the inspiration and motivation for the creation of the NMFS R User Group, which now has over 200 members and runs both an active Google Space and monthly webinars. The NMFS R User Group also maintains a calendar of free R trainings from across the broader R community. Members from these cohorts also joined efforts to create The NMFS Open Science Resource Book, where they share documentation, resources, and guidance. This includes automated NOAA Fisheries report templates in Quarto and RMarkdown, 508 compliance best practices, and GitHub guidance and project management across examples from across the agency. \nIn fall 2023, we grew as a community and focused on developing teaching, facilitation, and mentoring skills together. We learned coaching skills, which provided a new way to give and receive feedback. We participated in sessions dedicated to active listening, experiential learning, and designing for learners (protip: we are all learners)!\n\n\n“The skills we learned as Mentors can be applied to ongoing work and in the workplace without the need to do a training-specific project: in my experience, this aspect is unique to Openscapes. For example, I really valued the fresh perspective of coaching by asking open-ended constructive questions before (or instead of) giving feedback.” —Phoebe Woodworth-Jefcoats, Research Oceanographer at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center; Honolulu, HI\n\n\nThe importance and impact of establishing a Mentors community was evident in topic-based “Seaside Chats”. Seaside Chats are supportive and psychologically safe spaces. All attendees co-facilitate the meeting and foster open discussions around problems and barriers. Everyone is encouraged to actively contribute to shared notes and report-out documents, rather than leaving facilitation and note-taking responsibilities to one person. During our fall mentor training period, seaside chats worked as follows: one mentor would propose a topic that was important to them and add a seaside chat time to our shared calendar. Mentors from other centers or offices, who had never met before, would join the scheduled session. Despite the distance and barriers, participants easily recognized common challenges, asked questions, shared support solutions, and were able to generalize lessons learned for themselves and others. Between talking, adding to the shared notes, or offering +1’s (meaning “I agree” or “me, too”) in the meeting’s chat, participants learned and practiced several different strategies for connecting with others. During Seaside Chats mentors connected around topics like data visualization, data storage, documentation, and hybrid work environments. But they also connected around difficult topics for which there are no easy solutions, like overcoming frustrating administrative or technical barriers or situations where staff in different regions or offices face very different access to tools essential for reproducible science and data. \nDespite their organic nature, the connections and discussion across centers and offices can quickly catalyze solutions. For example, through the Seaside Chats, one AKRO staff member was able to learn about and leverage AFSC’s modern cloud tools including GitHub, Python, R, and storage buckets for large data sets. Seaside Chat members recognized new opportunities to consolidate the tools currently on-premise at the regional level to focus on providing more transparent and open access to specific data sets. This collaboration could lead to reduced support cost for tools that are presently maintained on-premise, such as custom virtual machines. Another direct outcome of the Seaside Chats during the fall mentor session was the development and implementation of the standard operating procedures (SOP) for GitHub Enterprise Cloud at the NWFSC. Discussions about barriers to open science adoption at NWFSC, identified that administrative roadblocks were creating a barrier to implementing a system that will be essential to successful open and reproducible science at the NWFSC. By discussing the issues with the mentor group, steps to move forward were identified and the SOP development was ‘unstuck’, began moving steadily forward, and was signed shortly after the fall session. \n\n\n\n\nExample of some of the NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Mentors Seaside Chat discussion themes and topics."

In 2023, NOAA Fisheries Mentors began connecting with Openscapes peers from other agencies and institutions, including NASA, EPA, Fred Hutch, and Pathways to Open Science. Together we developed coaching skills that make us better open data science mentors and co-authored a preprint entitled Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science, now in peer-review. At the Earth Science Information Partners July 2023 meeting, NMFS Openscapes spearheaded a session dedicated to Open Science and Open Data at NOAA Fisheries. NMFS and NASA Openscapers met in person at the ESIP meeting and later meet again in a larger virtual meeting to learn about the NASA experience with the Openscapes Mentors Framework and to learn from each other. In 2024, we will continue these connections with our Openscapes Mentors peers in other agencies and offices and expand our open science work together."
