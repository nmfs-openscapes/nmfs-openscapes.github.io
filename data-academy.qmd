title: "NMFS Openscapes Data Academy"
---

NMFS Openscapes is running a Data Academy Cohort in spring 2025! Read on to learn what this is and how to apply. The Data Academy is being led by Openscapes as part of the Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy. We will run this R for beginners program 3 times, annually in spring 2025 - 2027. 

Due to the high level of interest, we plan to hold 3 additional cohorts in the next 12 months for other R learners. The [Data Academy cohorts 2025](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQY1JpUZ9Ku2xF_Qb3jwxrCqFFAGYXn0_VqECOOEM3Q/edit?tab=t.0) doc outlines the plan for each cohort. 

Applications are now closed.

<!--- [Sign up for spring 2025] by close of business **March 25, 2025** ⬢ [Sample email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqktN5owu4rDCg37lh-eyDcw-wzsbRJ0eVrTfMN5eEQ/) to share announcement. --->

## What is the Data Academy?

**What:** You will learn R for data science through lessons on the [dataquest.io](http://dataquest.io) platform. See the [curriculum] below. The Data Academy is **asynchronous** so you can complete the lessons on your own schedule, and also **cohort-based** so you’ll get to know your colleagues and have accountability. The Openscapes team will provide support through optional **synchronous help desk hours and coworking** and a **dedicated Google Space** for help. A training certificate will be issued for each module completed.

**Expected time commitment**: Weekly for 3 months: 2-hour chunks of learning time, plus optional 1 hour of support from a "help desk" and coworking.

**When**: April 14 - July 17, 2025.

-   Mondays: Week’s lesson reminder received via email. Complete lesson on your own schedule.
-   Wednesdays: Help desk and coworking with the Openscapes team alongside other participants (Optional, via Zoom).

**Who**: FTEs and Affiliates from any Fisheries office are welcome to sign up. The 40 available spots will be distributed across centers and offices.

**Cost:** Free. There is no cost to staff or your center/office. This opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes.

## Curriculum

Dataquest offers many different "Learning Paths", including [Career Paths](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/career-paths/) and [Skill Paths](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/career-paths/). These Paths are composed of one or more courses, each of which consist of several modules.

Participants in the Data Academy will complete two Skill Paths:

#### [R Basics for Data Analysis](https://www.dataquest.io/path/r-basics-for-data-analysis/) (4 courses)

-   [Introduction to Data Analysis in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intro-to-r-rewrite/) (weeks 1-3)
-   [Data Structures in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/datastructure-in-r-rewrite/) (weeks 3-7)
-   [Control Flow, Iteration, and Functions in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intermediate-r/) (weeks 7-9)
-   [Specialized Data Processing in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/intermediate-r-part-two/) (weeks 9-11)

#### [Data Visualization with R](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-visualization-with-r/) (1 course)

-   [Introduction to Data Visualization in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/r-data-viz/) (weeks 11-13)

During the Data Academy, you will have access to the full dataquest.io library of courses in addition to the R Curriculum. Once you have completed the curriculum for your certificates, we recommend the following additional courses:

-   [Introduction to Data Cleaning in R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/r-data-viz-2/)
-   [Introduction to Git and Version Control](https://www.dataquest.io/course/git-and-vcs/)
-   [Querying Databases with SQL and R](https://www.dataquest.io/course/querying-databases-with-r/)

You will receive a certificate for each of the Skills Paths that you complete, as well as for individual courses.

## FAQ

**Who can participate?**

FTEs & Affiliates. We aim to get representation from all NOAA Fisheries science centers, regional offices, and strategic initiatives.

**What’s the minimum I need to know?**

Absolute beginners are encouraged to apply. No prerequisites. People should be comfortable working with data in other contexts (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, GIS, other languages such as Python, Matlab, etc.).

**I know a little bit of R. I’m trying to get better (self-taught), can I participate?**

Yes, you’re welcome, you’ll get a deeper understanding of what you already know and learn new skills beyond.

**How does it relate to Champions/Mentors?**

This is a separate program, but part of the broader Openscapes work with NOAA data and workforce modernization. Participants from past Champions and Mentors are welcome to apply and will learn different skills.

**How do I keep up with the material? What if I get stuck?**

While this is an asynchronous training, doing it with other people is valuable for accountability and to help each other when you’re stuck. Openscapes will host an optional weekly 1-hour help desk and coworking session where you can ask questions and we can discuss the material as a cohort.

**Will you offer the Data Academy at another time? This conflicts with my field season!**

Choosing a time is hard and we understand this timing will exclude some people; we might be able to start earlier in 2026. Openscapes Champions Cohorts are more intensive and we run those in fall when there are fewer field season conflicts. 

## Sign up for spring 2025

If you’re interested in participating, please add yourself to the [interest sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kzl6akKd030oz-qPzBrikVbHyrjOLR7EgG5emSDkq9Q/edit?usp=drive_link). Deadline to apply is close of business March 24.

## Selection

Selected applicants will be notified April 1. The 40 available spots will be distributed across centers and offices. Participants will be selected by the Openscapes team with input from NMFS Open Science staff and NMFS Openscapes Mentors. If people decline their offer to participate, we will select people from the waitlist, prioritizing people from the same division.
